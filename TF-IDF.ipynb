      "Chapter 616: Appreciation of a Major CharacterDing!“Congratulations, you’ve obtained Li Tie and Liu Yi’s respect because of your moral conduct and capabilities.Reward: 1 golden treasure chest!”Ding!“Congratulations on helping Xia Yuan comprehend a great teacher halo and obtaining an even greater amount of admiration and recognition.Reward: 1 mysterious treasure chest.”It was two rewards at one go.“Can you not give out rewards at such timings?”Sun Mo frowned.(It’s one thing if you give out the rewards late, but the notification always rings out at crucial moments.Who can bear this?)On the stage, Xuanyuan Po and Ding Er already started to fight.Sun Mo observed.Ding Er, 15 years old.Spirit-refinement realm.Originated from a mysterious manor.He has several types of spirit runes tattooed on his body.These spirit runes would increase his spirit qi absorption from the food he ate, strengthening his body from the roots.During combat, the runes could allow his body to erupt force with combat strength that’s several times his normal output.Potential value: Extremely highNote: Because of the instability of the spirit runes, once the runes are damaged, the flow of spirit qi would become disordered and convert into damage.Note: Although the spirit runes on his body still have flaws, it can already be considered a shocking masterpiece that’s worthy to learn from.Sun Mo glanced at Ding Er’s various data.His stats were a level below Xuanyuan Po but far surpassed the vast majority of his peers.What shocked Sun Mo was that the mysterious Dean Bai had already started to pay attention to energy absorption from food.One must know that the aboriginals of the Middle-Earth Nine Provinces would at most know the concept of tonic food.There were no theories yet.As for the athletes of the modern era, all their foods and drinks were strictly monitored.What could they eat, what could they drink, when could they do so…They were nurturing their bodies like a machine.“This Dragonspirit Manor is a little impressive!”Sun Mo sighed in admiration.The combat situation was similar to when Ding Wu had fought Xuanyuan Po.Ding Er wasn’t able to win against the combat addict and could only choose to activate the spirit runes on his body.But this time around, there was no need for Sun Mo to worry.Three minutes later, Tong Yiming stopped the competition.“What’s wrong?”Ding Er panted heavily and stared at Tong Yiming with an unkind look.His eruption state could only last for five minutes.Now that time was being wasted, the probability of his victory grew even smaller.“For this battle, Xuanyuan Po is the victor!”Tong Yiming announced directly.“WHY?”Ding Er roared.“If these spirit runes were tattooed onto you by your personal teacher, it couldn’t be considered against the rules.But if you continued fighting, you would end up as a cripple even if you don’t die.”Tong Yiming spoke in a strict tone of voice, “The battles between the top 64 are just demonstration battles to encourage the other examinees and students.It isn’t to kill one another for the sake of obtaining the championship.”“Who says I will become a cripple? I can clearly win!”Ding Er was unconvinced.After he spoke, he rushed toward Xuanyuan Po again as he still wanted to fight.However, Tong Yiming appeared before him and blocked him with a flash.“Where is his teacher? Come out and bring him away!”Tong Yiming berated.“There are no clear changes in the situation, but the main examiner already disrupted the match? How would the spectators be convinced?”Among the judges, Jiang Zhitong finally spoke.He didn’t care whether Ding Er lived or died.As long as he could make trouble for Sun Mo, Jiang Zhitong would feel happy.If he could annoy Sun Mo even more, that would be for the best.Honestly speaking, even Jiang Zhitong felt envy when he looked at Xuanyuan Po and he wanted to headhunt him.But when he thought about how this fellow was Sun Mo’s student, he wanted nothing more than for Xuanyuan Po to be quickly finished.“Teacher Jiang.As a head examiner, haven’t you heard of the case where one student died due to a backlash from spirit runes?”Mei Yazhi had an unchanging expression on her face.“As for the competition between these two students, isn’t it clear who’s stronger and who’s weaker after watching them?”(Why is it you again? Have you fallen in love with Sun Mo?)Jiang Zhitong was depressed, but he continued to dispute.“This is a rare chance for a youth to gain fame from a single battle.If you guys casually declared the winner, don’t you feel it’s a little too cruel?”“If he dies, will you take responsibility?”Mei Yazhi coldly laughed.(I’m not even afraid of your father Jiang Wei, why would I give a damn about you?)Jiang Zhitong choked, unable to bear such a responsibility.However, he had been working in the Saint Gate for so long and was naturally very cunning and intelligent enough to counter such things.“In that case, why don’t we let his teacher decide?”“Ridiculous!”Mei Yazhi couldn’t endure it anymore and directly stood up.“Vice alliance leader Liang, is this a main examiner you have selected? Someone that wants to tarnish a virtuous cause for his own personal benefit?”Liang Hongda immediately laughed.“Teacher Mei, please calm down.I think Teacher Jiang doesn’t mean that!”After Liang Hongda spoke, he passed a cup of tea to Mei Yazhi and seamlessly shot a glance at Jiang Zhitong.(You better shut up.)At this moment, Liang Hongda really wanted to tie Jiang Zhitong up and lash at him.(I know you are unhappy with Sun Mo and want to make trouble for him.However, can you please look at the situation? Your heart state is truly too narrow, no one can compare to you! Jiang Wei is such a magnanimous person, so why would he have a son like you?)“I feel ashamed that someone like this can be a main examiner!”Mei Yazhi didn’t take the cup and stood up, wanting to leave the panel.She couldn’t be bothered to be a main examiner anymore.“Teacher Mei, Teacher Mei, please calm your anger!”“Is there a need to do this? It isn’t worth it, it isn’t worth it at all!”“Teacher Jiang, why are you in a daze? Quickly apologize and help to persuade Teacher Mei!”The other major characters on the judging panel immediately tried to persuade and stop her.For a moment, the scene was extremely chaotic.Over 30,000 spectators were stunned.What was going on? And as for the examinees who had experience in the great teacher world, they were all extremely shocked.Sun Mo actually had so much face.Mei Yazhi had clashed against Jiang Zhitong for him.Moreover, she wanted to leave the judging panel in anger.(My heavens, what exactly is the relationship between them?)One must know that other than being a 3-star great teacher, Jiang Zhitong was the next pillar of the Jiang Clan.By offending him, it was equal to offending the entire Jiang Clan.Was it worth it for Sun Mo?For a time, not only the examinees, but even the examiners felt envy toward Sun Mo.With a major character like Mei Yazhi as his backer, Sun Mo would definitely be able to lead a comfortable life in the future.Actually, everyone had misunderstood Mei Yazhi.She did feel some good will toward Sun Mo, but she chose to speak out now mostly for the sake of Saint Gate’s reputation.If she allowed Jiang Zhitong to continue with his nonsensical way, the hearts of many low-ranked great teachers and students might turn cold.“Why should I apologize?”After hearing a major character want him to apologize, Jiang Zhitong’s expression immediately turned ashen.Bang!Someone slammed a palm on the table.“I’m not going to be the main examiner anymore!”Another 6-star major character walked away.After that, three more people joined him.As great teachers, their level of integrity was very high, and they placed an emphasis on justice.Besides, they had long since been unhappy about Jiang Zhitong who depended on the status of his family to act wantonly.“What are you guys doing? Why are you acting out like this in public?”Liang Hongda was almost angered to the point of coughing up blood, but nothing could be done.He turned toward Jiang Zhitong and spoke, “Teacher Jiang, I can see that you aren’t feeling well from your complexion.Please go and take a rest first.”This was already a very tactful way to speak.After all, he couldn’t possibly tell Jiang Zhitong to scram, or he would surely offend him to the max.Jiang Zhitong’s fists instantly clenched, but since the matter had blown up, he truly had no more face to continue being in the judging panel.Hence, he turned and left.He even kicked aside a chair blocking his way.“Teacher Mei, are you satisfied now?”Liang Hongda bitterly smiled.“Vice leader Liang, I know you wish to pull some powers to support you so you can fight for the leader position.However, a person like Jiang Zhitong will only blacken your reputation.”Mei Yazhi shook her head and sat down.“Drink tea, drink tea!”Liang Hongda felt depressed and finally got all the major characters to sit back down.Mei Yazhi was already an alchemy grandmaster.Moreover, there was an 80% chance that she would become an alchemy ancestor ten years later.Liang Hongda would definitely never offend her even if his brains were spoiled.Right now, he could only wrong Jiang Zhitong.“Damn!”“Damn!”In a private resting room, Jiang Zhitong smashed everything there.Actually, he knew that he shouldn’t have made that comment.However, he was used to everything going his way and had never suffered setbacks before.Who would have expected that he would ‘fall’ to Sun Mo’s hands today?This was the first setback he had ever faced in life.“Mei Yazhi, Sun Mo.Just wait for my revenge!”Jiang Zhitong hated Sun Mo more and more.Ding Er got down the stage after Xuanyuan Po was announced the winner.The battles then continued.No one felt that there were shadowy and unsavory things going on behind the scene.In fact, they felt that the Saint Gate was just and fair.After all, Xuanyuan Po was fighting against a fellow with spirit runes tattooed on his body.In the hearts of everyone, such an act was equal to taking a shortcut.This was despised by the vast majority of people.Dean Bai looked at Xuanyuan Po with an intoxicated look in his eyes.He wanted nothing more than to immediately engrave spirit runes on Xuanyuan Po’s body.Xuanyuan Po was absolutely the most perfect experimental body.“I think Grandmaster Mei is treating you like her son-in-law.”Gu Xiuxun appeared to be joking, but her eyes were fixed on Sun Mo, observing his expression.“Don’t speak blindly.Your words will destroy Ziyu’s reputation.”Sun Mo reminded.“Ziyu!” Gu Xiuxun’s lips twitched.“The way you address her sounds so intimate!”“What are you thinking about? Don’t I also call you Xiuxun?”“I suddenly feel balanced psychologically when you put it like this!”Gu Xiuxun punched Sun Mo lightly.After she hesitated a little, she lowered her voice and persuaded, “Sun Mo, regardless of whether Mei Yazhi looks highly on your looks or talent, she is a major character.You have to hang on to her tightly.Don’t act hypocritical and don’t be overly prideful.Not everyone would have such an opportunity.”If it wasn’t for Mei Yazhi speaking, Tong Yiming’s words would have no weight to them, and Xuanyuan Po and Ding Er would have to continue fighting.In the end, Ding Er would be crippled and Xuanyuan Po wouldn’t feel good either.Ding Er might hate Mei Yazhi for not giving him the chance to win, but in the future, he would understand that Mei Yazhi actually did so for his future.“Thanks!”Sun Mo could hear the concern in Gu Xiuxun’s voice.“However, I don’t like to hang on to and burden others.I will be the strongest support where others can hang on to me instead!”“Che!”Gu Xiuxun gestured with her index finger.She learned this from Sun Mo, but she felt that pointing a middle finger wasn’t elegant so she had swapped to the index finger instead.Liu Mubai who was sitting in the corner glanced at Mei Yazhi and then at Sun Mo.He felt as though he was drinking a hundred-year vinegar.How sour!The first day of matches simply passed with no further accident.The second day arrived.Jiang Leng’s opponent was Gui Jiarong.“Aiya, the gaze of this fellow is so terrifying!”Lu Zhiruo forcefully clutched the corners of Li Ziqi’s shirt, not wanting to eat her melons anymore.“Luckily, his opponent isn’t Baiwu!”The little sunny egg also felt dread in her heart.This fellow was Shan Shi’s personal student and most probably would have some capabilities.“Let’s make things clear first.I will definitely not show mercy.If you don’t forfeit now, don’t regret if I cripple you later!”Gui Jiarong had a malevolent expression.The longsword in his hand glowed with a bizarre black-colored light.\n"

      "Chapter 617: Sun Mo’s on-the-spot GuidanceAlthough Shan Shi was defeated by Sun Mo, he was still the biggest dark horse among this batch of examinees.Not only was he arrogant, but his bizarre weapon also caused fear and trepidation in the hearts of others.As Shan Shi’s student, Gui Jiarong naturally entered everyone’s radar.Ever since the student battle started, his performance was relatively excellent, and all the opponents he faced were insta-defeated.Hence, the match Jiang Leng vs.Gui Jiarong would surely be a fascinating one to watch.Those who had watched Gui Jiarong’s matches before knew that he was serious when he said that.It wasn’t a psychological trick as he would really cripple Jiang Leng.Because he had always been so ruthless and cruel.However, this time around, the deadman face of Jiang Leng showed no change to his expression.“Hmph, I want to see how long you can be calm for!”Gui Jiarong coldly snorted.His shoulders shook slightly and in the eyes of some spectators, his body was like penciled words that became faint after being rubbed by an eraser.Hua~Many people exclaimed in shock.Even Tong Yiming felt surprised because he wasn’t able to see Gui Jiarong’s silhouette from his position.It was as though Gui Jiarong had vanished into thin air.“Is it a cultivation art or some type of dark secret arts? Or an effect of the sword he is wielding?”Tong Yiming guessed as he glanced over at Jiang Leng.After that, he involuntarily exclaimed silently in amazement.Good spirit!Honestly speaking, if it was his younger-self in Jiang Leng’s position, he would definitely be extremely nervous and wouldn’t know what to do because an unknown enemy was more terrifying compared to a strong enemy.However, the expression of this youth didn’t change at all!(Wait a minute.Could it be that he has no expression?)Tong Yiming suddenly recalled that he had met Jiang Leng quite a few times before and had never seen a change in his expression.He would always put up a deadman face.“I think we still have to look at the end result!”Tong Yiming retracted his admiration.…“Haha, are you scared now?”Gui Jiarong’s laughter rang out on stage, filled with disdain and provocation.“You can’t even see where your opponent is.Do you feel despair now?“Don’t worry, the thing that makes people feel true despair still has not happened yet!”At this moment, Jiang Leng, who had been quietly standing there, suddenly moved.He turned his body and his right hand that was holding a dagger punched out.Bang!Gui Jiarong’s laughter abruptly stopped.He was knocked out of invisibility as he stumbled backward.Pu!Tong Yiming couldn’t help but laugh out loud.In his eyes, Gui Jiarong was like someone who went knocking on Jiang Leng’s door, begging for a beating.He had managed to block the attack, but the impact caused the shape of his face to change.Also, blood dripped from Gui Jiarong’s nose, splattering on the floor.“Impressive!”Tong Yiming subconsciously wanted to applaud but after that, he recalled his identity as a main examiner and put his hands down quickly.Gui Jiarong hurriedly climbed up and prepared to enter stealth once more because he was worried that Jiang Leng would charge over and take this chance to attack him.However, he soon discovered that this youth with the word ‘cripple’ on his forehead continued standing at his original location after throwing out that punch.Gui Jiarong started.After that, his expression turned ashen.“Are you looking down on me?”This confident and at ease attitude from Jiang Leng completely infuriated him.“Do you have any aspect that’s worthy of me looking up to?”Jiang Leng counter-asked as he blinked his large eyes.Pu!Let alone the spectators, even the main examiners on the judging panel were unable to restrain their laughter.“It’s stable now!’Lu Zhiruo calmed down and continued eating her melons.Li Ziqi shook her head.It was one thing if Jiang Leng didn’t speak.However, the moment he did, he would anger people to death.“You are courting death!”Gui Jiarong howled.His body vanished on the stage.“Go to hell!”Jiang Leng’s lips curled.He waited for a while and suddenly punched out toward his right again.Bang!Gui Jiarong stumbled once more.This time around, because his mouth got hit, he spat out three broken teeth.“Oh, yay!”Lu Zhiruo cheered.Now, Gui Jiarong who climbed to his feet glared at Jiang Leng, and he no longer dared to speak ruthlessly.His expression showed unprecedented heaviness because this fellow had seen through his battle style.“Did you realize what’s happening now?”Jiang Leng mocked.“Do you think I wouldn’t know that you were purposely speaking to me earlier to lure me to the location of your voice?”“How can you be certain of my position?” Gui Jiarong asked.“You have body odor!”Jiang Leng’s words were concise and comprehensive.All the people were stunned.After that, uproarious laughter rang throughout the area.Gui Jiarong was stunned as well.After that, rage suffused his face as he lunged over.“I WILL KILL YOU!”“Ai~’Tong Yiming sighed.Gui Jiarong had lost his balance psychologically and he would lose for sure.He wanted to pull a psychological trick to win, but he didn’t succeed.On the contrary, he got counter-provoked by Jiang Leng and lost his calm.In the spectator stands, Bai Wenzhang felt gratified when he saw Jiang Leng’s performance, but he also felt some disappointment.Such a good student.It was a pity that Jiang Leng was a failed experiment.If not, Jiang Leng would surely become his most perfect masterpiece.“Teacher, how can Jiang Leng find that fellow?”Lu Zhiruo didn’t understand.“Ziqi, what do you think?”Sun Mo counter-asked.“Through sound?”The little sunny egg guessed.“That’s right!”Sun Mo nodded.“Although Gui Jiarong was very careful and avoided making any sounds, to Jiang Leng who all six senses are sharp, he is as clear as a frog calling out at night and just as annoying.”Gui Jiarong clearly discovered this point.Hence, this time around, he didn’t vanish.When he was near Jiang Leng, his body trembled and three additional clones suddenly appeared.“Ah?”The papaya girl was shocked.What should Jiang Leng do now?“You must be badly frightened, right?”Gui Jiarong was very complacent, wanting to see a look of fear and panic on Jiang Leng’s face.However, he was destined to be disappointed because Jiang Leng still showed his same old deadman face.Three clones and an original body attacked together.Their longswords angrily whistled as they slashed at Jiang Leng.Cheers rang out from the spectator stands.Just when the four swords slashed toward Jiang Leng’s head, he finally moved.He was like a leopard hunting prey, charging right at a Gui Jiarong as he stabbed out continuously with his dagger.Pu! Pu! Pu!The sharp dagger stabbed at Gui Jiarong’s wrists, arms, and shoulders.After that, Jiang Leng simply kneed him.Bang!Gui Jiarong’s stomach was struck.After that, his entire body was pushed up into the air from Jiang Leng’s repeated combos.Finally, Jiang Leng turned and his right leg lashed out like a whip, kicking Gui Jiarong’s head.Bang!Gui Jiarong felt like he got rammed head-on by a horse.His head was dizzy and his vision blurry.After that, he flew through the air like a broken sack before slamming into the ground and rolling back from the impact.The expressions of the audience were filled with astonishment.It ended just like that?Wasn’t it a little too fast?Honestly speaking, they were still shocked that Gui Jiarong could use such a powerful cloning technique and thought that it was all over for Jiang Leng.“Thanks for letting me win!”Jiang Leng clasped his hands and walked down the stage.“Come back, let’s continue.I haven’t lost yet!”Gui Jiarong’s expression froze.After that, he began to howl with rage.(I lost? Impossible, this must be an illusion! Alright, even if it is real, I can still fight!)Tong Yiming glanced at Gui Jiarong, “Jiang Leng is the victor of this match!”“Shut up, I can still fight!” Gui Jiarong roared.“If you wish to be beaten to death, I won’t stop you!”Tong Yiming had an unhappy look on his face.“You can still fight? Take a look at your right hand!”Gui Jiarong turned his head after hearing this and saw that his right arm looked extremely gory.Even worse, he could only hear a rumbling sound in his left ear.Fresh blood was flowing out of it.Jiang Leng’s kick didn’t know mercy and had directly ruptured his eardrum.Ma Zhang went over to treat Gui Jiarong.After a short silence, the entire battle dojo erupted into thunderous applause.Gui Jiarong was very powerful.He had an invisibility technique and a clone technique, which were both very hard to deal with, yet Jiang Leng had easily crushed him.Such overwhelming strength could truly make people feel despair.Also, the talent he displayed caused many people to covet him.“Teacher, I was fortunate that I didn’t disgrace you!”Jiang Leng returned to Sun Mo and bowed low.“Well done!”Sun Mo praised.“How strong!”Gu Xiuxun clicked her tongue.All the other examinees were also looking at Jiang Leng.Their gazes were filled with admiration, but they also felt bewildered.(Is the word ‘cripple’ on your forehead fake? Something you used to act cool?)“It’s Teacher who has taught me so well.”Jiang Leng didn’t dare to accept Sun Mo’s praise and was very humble as well as courteous.He didn’t become arrogant because he was satisfied with his accomplishment.(Zeze, look at this student.He knows how to give face to his teacher so well!)The great teachers on the scene were so envious that they almost drooled.Liu Mubai turned and looked at Han Zisheng who was beside him.He suddenly felt that it would be very hard to win the championship.“Why didn’t I discover that Jiang Leng was actually so powerful back then?”Liu Mubai felt regret.One could only say that Sun Mo’s God Hands were magical and had forcibly reversed Jiang Leng’s fate.Ding!Favorable impression points from Liu Mubai +100.Friendly (750/1,000).“Junior brother Jiang, eat a melon!”Lu Zhiruo passed a piece of watermelon over.After that, her eyes were filled with desire for knowledge as she asked, “How did you determine which was his true body? You couldn’t possibly have depended on sound, right?”Just when Jiang Leng wanted to reply, Tantai Yutang interjected.“It’s better to ask such a question from our teacher!”The sickly invalid laughed.“Tantai!”Jiang Leng frowned.(Our teacher didn’t participate in the fight, so how would he know? If Teacher couldn’t answer it, how embarrassing would things be?)“Hehe!”Sun Mo calmly smiled and glanced at Tantai Yutang, not feeling put off by such pranks.He didn’t mind explaining.“Jiang Leng didn’t depend on sound this time around to differentiate them.He was depending on psychology.Hmm, you can understand this as guessing what your opponent would do by putting yourself in their shoes and gauging their reaction to find the real body.”Upon hearing this, Jiang Leng’s eyes brightened.His teacher actually knew about this?Ding!Favorable impression points from Jiang Leng +500.Respect (8,500/10,000).“Ah?”Lu Zhiruo clearly didn’t understand, but Li Ziqi and the others sank into contemplation.“Just consider Gui Jiarong’s personality.He is brash, arrogant, and likes to crush his enemies utterly.A person like this definitely won’t let his clones attack Jiang Leng, but if he attacked first, he might be blocked.Hence, the body that attacked right after the first was the true body.”Sun Mo analyzed.“Is that the case?”Lu Zhiruo looked at Jiang Leng.“Yes, all of his three clones are very real.Be it their shadows, breathing, voices—they are completely identical, so I decided to gamble using psychology.”Jiang Leng explained.“Ah? That fellow only took two seconds to summon his clones, right? Yet, you actually thought of so many things in such a short period?”The papaya girl was stunned.She blinked her eyes and had a look of worship in her gaze when she looked at Jiang Leng.(I also wish to become as impressive as you.)“The impressive one is our teacher.He could even guess my thoughts correctly.”Jiang Leng modestly spoke.“I agree with this!”Ying Baiwu nodded.Ding!Favorable impression points from Ying Baiwu +200.Respect (9,500/10,000).“Aiya, I know that our teacher is impressive!” The papaya girl was surprised.“In the past, I’ve always felt that among all of us, the one best at fighting is Xuanyuan Po.But it seems that you are not any inferior to him.Oh right, if we add brains into the calculations, he is actually inferior to you.”“What do you mean by these words?” The combat addict rolled his eyes.“Are you saying that I have no brains?”“Do you have them?”The fellow martial siblings laughed and chatted.“If this is not my brain, what is it?”Xuanyuan Po was indignant and stretched out his index finger, forcefully jabbing his head.“If I had no brains, I would have died long ago!”“…”The other martial siblings were speechless.(We are talking about brains, that’s your head!)“It’s a reality now.Xuanyuan Po has no brains.”Zhang Yanzong felt that if one took this aspect into consideration, he might be able to defeat Xuanyuan Po.“Interesting!”Li Ruolan involuntarily murmured.After that, she took out her notebook and quickly recorded the details of the conversation, wanting to write a good draft.“Ah?”Lu Zhiruo jumped in fright.(When did you appear? Moreover, you were eavesdropping on our conversation.This isn’t too good, right?)Li Ziqi suddenly lifted her foot and stomped on the sickly invalid’s toes while no one paid attention.“Don’t find trouble for Teacher anymore!”The little sunny egg used her gaze to warn him.…“Too foolish.”Yao Guang sat beside the Daybreak Starlord and involuntarily shook her head.“Should we finish this?”“Remember to make use of trash!”The Daybreak Starlord drank a sip of his sugared soy milk before instructing.“Mn!”Yao Guang looked at Ying Baiwu and walked toward the stage.“Don’t tell me you are planning to act? Remember to show mercy.Don’t kill Sun Mo’s students.”The Daybreak Starlord advised.“Can I cripple them?”Yao Guang giggled.“This match will be interesting, so you have to pay more attention to it!” Yao Guang spoke.The Daybreak Starlord also felt his interest stirring.On the stage, Ying Baiwu had the Wind King Divine Bow in her hands and a heavy look on her face.This was because her opponent exuded a very bizarre aura.She was clad in a large green-colored mantle, and not even her eyes were revealed.This strange dress caused Sun Mo to involuntarily activate his Divine Sight.“Unknown lifeform, it is created into a humanoid shape through various dark secret arts and rare plants.At its base, it is a type of plant but has its own thinking ability.You can call it a plant person.”“Huh?”Sun Mo had a stunned look on his face.This meant that Ying Baiwu’s opponent wasn’t human?“Teacher Sun!” Mei Ziyu walked over.“I didn’t expect our students to meet.”“…”Sun Mo turned his head and surveyed Mei Ziyu.He suddenly felt like sighing with sorrow.He had always believed that his attainments in planting techniques and herbology were already very impressive.He didn’t expect that when compared to Mei Ziyu, he would be so much weaker.(Damn, she actually cultivated and grew a plant person?)“What’s wrong?”Mei Ziyu was puzzled.Sun Mo’s expression didn’t look normal.(Could it be that he has discovered my secret? No, this is impossible.Even my mother doesn’t know about it!)Chapter 617: Sun Mo’s on-the-spot GuidanceAlthough Shan Shi was defeated by Sun Mo, he was still the biggest dark horse among this batch of examinees.Not only was he arrogant, but his bizarre weapon also caused fear and trepidation in the hearts of others.As Shan Shi’s student, Gui Jiarong naturally entered everyone’s radar.Ever since the student battle started, his performance was relatively excellent, and all the opponents he faced were insta-defeated.Hence, the match Jiang Leng vs.Gui Jiarong would surely be a fascinating one to watch.Those who had watched Gui Jiarong’s matches before knew that he was serious when he said that.It wasn’t a psychological trick as he would really cripple Jiang Leng.Because he had always been so ruthless and cruel.However, this time around, the deadman face of Jiang Leng showed no change to his expression.“Hmph, I want to see how long you can be calm for!”Gui Jiarong coldly snorted.His shoulders shook slightly and in the eyes of some spectators, his body was like penciled words that became faint after being rubbed by an eraser.Hua~Many people exclaimed in shock.Even Tong Yiming felt surprised because he wasn’t able to see Gui Jiarong’s silhouette from his position.It was as though Gui Jiarong had vanished into thin air.“Is it a cultivation art or some type of dark secret arts? Or an effect of the sword he is wielding?”Tong Yiming guessed as he glanced over at Jiang Leng.After that, he involuntarily exclaimed silently in amazement.Good spirit!Honestly speaking, if it was his younger-self in Jiang Leng’s position, he would definitely be extremely nervous and wouldn’t know what to do because an unknown enemy was more terrifying compared to a strong enemy.However, the expression of this youth didn’t change at all!(Wait a minute.Could it be that he has no expression?)Tong Yiming suddenly recalled that he had met Jiang Leng quite a few times before and had never seen a change in his expression.He would always put up a deadman face.“I think we still have to look at the end result!”Tong Yiming retracted his admiration.…“Haha, are you scared now?”Gui Jiarong’s laughter rang out on stage, filled with disdain and provocation.“You can’t even see where your opponent is.Do you feel despair now?“Don’t worry, the thing that makes people feel true despair still has not happened yet!”At this moment, Jiang Leng, who had been quietly standing there, suddenly moved.He turned his body and his right hand that was holding a dagger punched out.Bang!Gui Jiarong’s laughter abruptly stopped.He was knocked out of invisibility as he stumbled backward.Pu!Tong Yiming couldn’t help but laugh out loud.In his eyes, Gui Jiarong was like someone who went knocking on Jiang Leng’s door, begging for a beating.He had managed to block the attack, but the impact caused the shape of his face to change.Also, blood dripped from Gui Jiarong’s nose, splattering on the floor.“Impressive!”Tong Yiming subconsciously wanted to applaud but after that, he recalled his identity as a main examiner and put his hands down quickly.Gui Jiarong hurriedly climbed up and prepared to enter stealth once more because he was worried that Jiang Leng would charge over and take this chance to attack him.However, he soon discovered that this youth with the word ‘cripple’ on his forehead continued standing at his original location after throwing out that punch.Gui Jiarong started.After that, his expression turned ashen.“Are you looking down on me?”This confident and at ease attitude from Jiang Leng completely infuriated him.“Do you have any aspect that’s worthy of me looking up to?”Jiang Leng counter-asked as he blinked his large eyes.Pu!Let alone the spectators, even the main examiners on the judging panel were unable to restrain their laughter.“It’s stable now!’Lu Zhiruo calmed down and continued eating her melons.Li Ziqi shook her head.It was one thing if Jiang Leng didn’t speak.However, the moment he did, he would anger people to death.“You are courting death!”Gui Jiarong howled.His body vanished on the stage.“Go to hell!”Jiang Leng’s lips curled.He waited for a while and suddenly punched out toward his right again.Bang!Gui Jiarong stumbled once more.This time around, because his mouth got hit, he spat out three broken teeth.“Oh, yay!”Lu Zhiruo cheered.Now, Gui Jiarong who climbed to his feet glared at Jiang Leng, and he no longer dared to speak ruthlessly.His expression showed unprecedented heaviness because this fellow had seen through his battle style.“Did you realize what’s happening now?”Jiang Leng mocked.“Do you think I wouldn’t know that you were purposely speaking to me earlier to lure me to the location of your voice?”“How can you be certain of my position?” Gui Jiarong asked.“You have body odor!”Jiang Leng’s words were concise and comprehensive.All the people were stunned.After that, uproarious laughter rang throughout the area.Gui Jiarong was stunned as well.After that, rage suffused his face as he lunged over.“I WILL KILL YOU!”“Ai~’Tong Yiming sighed.Gui Jiarong had lost his balance psychologically and he would lose for sure.He wanted to pull a psychological trick to win, but he didn’t succeed.On the contrary, he got counter-provoked by Jiang Leng and lost his calm.In the spectator stands, Bai Wenzhang felt gratified when he saw Jiang Leng’s performance, but he also felt some disappointment.Such a good student.It was a pity that Jiang Leng was a failed experiment.If not, Jiang Leng would surely become his most perfect masterpiece.“Teacher, how can Jiang Leng find that fellow?”Lu Zhiruo didn’t understand.“Ziqi, what do you think?”Sun Mo counter-asked.“Through sound?”The little sunny egg guessed.“That’s right!”Sun Mo nodded.“Although Gui Jiarong was very careful and avoided making any sounds, to Jiang Leng who all six senses are sharp, he is as clear as a frog calling out at night and just as annoying.”Gui Jiarong clearly discovered this point.Hence, this time around, he didn’t vanish.When he was near Jiang Leng, his body trembled and three additional clones suddenly appeared.“Ah?”The papaya girl was shocked.What should Jiang Leng do now?“You must be badly frightened, right?”Gui Jiarong was very complacent, wanting to see a look of fear and panic on Jiang Leng’s face.However, he was destined to be disappointed because Jiang Leng still showed his same old deadman face.Three clones and an original body attacked together.Their longswords angrily whistled as they slashed at Jiang Leng.Cheers rang out from the spectator stands.Just when the four swords slashed toward Jiang Leng’s head, he finally moved.He was like a leopard hunting prey, charging right at a Gui Jiarong as he stabbed out continuously with his dagger.Pu! Pu! Pu!The sharp dagger stabbed at Gui Jiarong’s wrists, arms, and shoulders.After that, Jiang Leng simply kneed him.Bang!Gui Jiarong’s stomach was struck.After that, his entire body was pushed up into the air from Jiang Leng’s repeated combos.Finally, Jiang Leng turned and his right leg lashed out like a whip, kicking Gui Jiarong’s head.Bang!Gui Jiarong felt like he got rammed head-on by a horse.His head was dizzy and his vision blurry.After that, he flew through the air like a broken sack before slamming into the ground and rolling back from the impact.The expressions of the audience were filled with astonishment.It ended just like that?Wasn’t it a little too fast?Honestly speaking, they were still shocked that Gui Jiarong could use such a powerful cloning technique and thought that it was all over for Jiang Leng.“Thanks for letting me win!”Jiang Leng clasped his hands and walked down the stage.“Come back, let’s continue.I haven’t lost yet!”Gui Jiarong’s expression froze.After that, he began to howl with rage.(I lost? Impossible, this must be an illusion! Alright, even if it is real, I can still fight!)Tong Yiming glanced at Gui Jiarong, “Jiang Leng is the victor of this match!”“Shut up, I can still fight!” Gui Jiarong roared.“If you wish to be beaten to death, I won’t stop you!”Tong Yiming had an unhappy look on his face.“You can still fight? Take a look at your right hand!”Gui Jiarong turned his head after hearing this and saw that his right arm looked extremely gory.Even worse, he could only hear a rumbling sound in his left ear.Fresh blood was flowing out of it.Jiang Leng’s kick didn’t know mercy and had directly ruptured his eardrum.Ma Zhang went over to treat Gui Jiarong.After a short silence, the entire battle dojo erupted into thunderous applause.Gui Jiarong was very powerful.He had an invisibility technique and a clone technique, which were both very hard to deal with, yet Jiang Leng had easily crushed him.Such overwhelming strength could truly make people feel despair.Also, the talent he displayed caused many people to covet him.“Teacher, I was fortunate that I didn’t disgrace you!”Jiang Leng returned to Sun Mo and bowed low.“Well done!”Sun Mo praised.“How strong!”Gu Xiuxun clicked her tongue.All the other examinees were also looking at Jiang Leng.Their gazes were filled with admiration, but they also felt bewildered.(Is the word ‘cripple’ on your forehead fake?

      "Chapter 618: Gathering of GeniusesOn the stage, when Ying Baiwu started fighting against the plant person, exclamations of shock soon rang out.The arrows shot by the iron-headed girl hit the student in the green cloak and mantle, but it was as though the arrows had struck glass.They shattered into countless motes of light.“What’s going on?”“Not sure, but I guess it is a type of dark secret arts?”“Hehe, this girl finally met her bane.”The spectators discussed.Those examinees whose students had lost to Ying Baiwu actually rejoiced in the face of her misfortune.Ying Baiwu executed the Wind King Divine Steps and furiously lengthened the distance between them.After that, she channeled force into her arm and started flicking her bowstring.Swish~Spirit qi gushed forth from her finger and imbued the bow, manifesting a semi-transparent arrow.In fact, because the fluctuations of spirit qi were too intense, thumb-sized tornados could be seen in the bow’s surroundings.Wind King Roar!BOOM!The arrow whistled through the air.Everywhere it passed, it caused qi waves and clouds of dust to rise from the ground.In fact, a huge gorge actually opened up through the stone flooring from the force of the shot.Although the gorge wasn’t too deep, the terrifying destructive prowess of the arrow was extremely immense.Sadly, it was still useless!BOOM!The arrow slammed into the body of the plant person.After that, things seemed to be the same as before.The arrow shattered and vanished, causing no damage.Ying Baiwu didn’t even frown.She placed her bow behind her shoulder and pulled out her sword as she lunged toward the plant person.She wanted to fight in close combat.Upon seeing this, Mei Ziyu started.After that, she couldn’t help but clap.The major characters on the judging panel also started to applaud.Since the archery she was most proficient in was useless against the enemy, normal people would definitely feel worried and become nervous.In fact, they might keep on thinking about how to break the situation.But this iron-headed girl didn’t do so.She directly switched to using her sword and lunged over.Leaving aside whether this battle strategy was correct or not, just this action could already display her resolution, calmness, and decisiveness.It was truly worthy of admiration.Naturally, the most important thing was courage.The vast majority of people, when they encountered the unclear situation where their arrows vanished, would definitely choose to temporarily take an evasive stance.Because the unknown was always the most terrifying.However, this young girl was truly iron-headed.“This student of Sun Mo is so gusty!”Liang Hongda marveled with a look of admiration on his face.“Why? Is vice alliance leader Liang feeling a stir in your heart?”A major character teased.This was because Liang Hongda was proficient in archery.“Yeah, it’s rare to meet an unpolished jade!”Liang Hongda sighed ruefully and looked at his assistant.“I heard that two years ago, this girl was still a swill transporter? She was discovered by Sun Mo?”“Yup!”The assistant had long since memorized the detailed history of these students because he was worried that things would be bad if he couldn’t answer when his boss was interested in one of the students.“Zeze, Sun Mo’s judgment is truly outstanding!”Liang Hongda praised Sun Mo as the notion of headhunting Sun Mo surfaced in his mind again.In the great teacher world, there was no lack of great teachers with good judgment, but the vast majority of these teachers were aged ones.Their so-called judgment was actually accumulated experience gained through several years from seeing so many students.For someone like Sun Mo who was so young yet had such sharp judgment…There truly weren’t many.“God Hands is really impressive!”A major character suddenly sighed in admiration.“Hehe!”Liang Hongda laughed.God Hands had nothing to do with this.Sun Mo couldn’t possibly be so idle to check the body of a swill-transporter for no reason, right?Sun Mo must have seen this girl doing something that triggered his interest.Ding!Favorable impression points from Liang Hongda +20.Friendly (310/1,000).One couldn’t help but say that this vice leader truly did have some capabilities.“Vice Alliance Leader Liang, if you want some students, I will introduce a few next time!”Mei Yazhi suddenly spoke.“Alright!”Liang Hongda had a smile on his face, but he was cursing in his heart.He knew Mei Yazhi was reminding him not to snatch Sun Mo’s student.In the cultivation realm, many geniuses were godly with using common weapons such as swords and sabers.But only a few were good in archery.Just from looking at history, there were so many famous generals.But how many of them were divine archers? From this, one could already tell how rare this occupation was.Moreover, even if all of them were good students, there were different tiers of strength.Someone like Ying Baiwu definitely belonged to the first tier.No, most probably she was at the supreme unique tier, right?Liang Hongda watched Ying Baiwu fighting in close combat and couldn’t help but want to speak out to guide her.He wanted to say that there was no need to fear, even if she used her bow, she could still win.Sadly, he wasn’t able to do so because this was a personal student of Sun Mo.“Damn, what dogshit luck does this Sun Mo have?!”Liang Hongda’s emotions were chaotic.He felt that there was a need for him to properly discuss things with Ying Baiwu, or her talent in archery might be wasted by Sun Mo.“Teacher Mei, what’s going on?”Lu Zhiruo was dumbstruck and worry could be seen on her face.Her junior martial sister seemed about to lose!“Zhiruo, don’t be rude!”Sun Mo reminded.Asking another person about their secret was a great taboo in the great teacher world.“Actually nothing much.It’s because of the body!”Mei Ziyu felt a little embarrassed.Although the examiners wouldn’t be able to see through the secret of the plant person due to her dark secret arts, it was after all a violation of the rules.“There’s a body that can cancel out spirit qi arrows?”The papaya girl blinked her eyes and recalled the books she read.Hmm, there didn’t seem to be something like this.However, people like this were all rarely seen even in a hundred years.If they were discovered, they would definitely be protected by the Saint Gate.Li Ziqi frowned, feeling that this student clad in the green mantle wasn’t normal.“This is a student battle but there are no rules stating that only humans can participate.”Sun Mo could see that Mei Ziyu was feeling conflict, hence, he spoke out.Actually, it could be considered a rare experience for Ying Baiwu to fight with a plant human.“Ah?”Mei Ziyu’s heart pounded, and she subconsciously looked at Sun Mo.(It can’t be, right? Did he actually see through it?)(No, even my mother hasn’t discovered this during all this while.How can it be possible that Sun Mo… Yes, he must have made that remark casually.)After that, this girl with waist-long raven black hair saw Sun Mo looking at her eyes.There was no anger in his gaze that might arise from seeing an opponent breaking the rules.There was just tranquility as though he was trying to comfort her.All of a sudden, Mei Ziyu panicked, feeling a heavy sense of self-reproach in her heart.“Teacher, if the one participating isn’t a human, what can it be then?”The papaya girl was amazed and a little afraid.She involuntarily hugged Sun Mo’s arm tightly.“Could it be a dead person?”“I’ve not fought against a dead person before!”Xuanyuan Po felt his battle desire rising.At this moment, the plant person, who was originally equally matched with Ying Baiwu, suddenly suffered a kick and fell off the stage.Hence, the entire arena turned quiet.This ending was a little unexpected.Sun Mo started.After that, he shook his head and smiled bitterly before lowering his voice to persuade Mei Ziyu.“Teacher Mei, you don’t have to do this!”Sun Mo knew that the plant person’s ‘careless’ loss was because Mei Ziyu commanded it to do so.“Sorry!”Mei Ziyu mumbled in a small voice.Actually, the reason why she came here was to take the examination together with Sun Mo, so she could have a beautiful memory.Since she had obtained the title of a 2-star great teacher, she didn’t mind losing now.Gu Xiuxun’s lips twitched when she saw Sun Mo and Mei Ziyu whispering to each other, feeling a little disappointed.“Ying Baiwu won this round!”Tong Yiming announced and the matches continued.It was time for the ‘C’ group.Zhang Yanzong went up the stage.“Yanzong, I will be cheering you on!”Gu Xiuxun shouted loudly.She originally still wanted to guide Zhang Yanzong to prove her ability.But who knew that two minutes later, Zhang Yanzong was knocked off the stage by a girl named Zhou Yao.He lost so badly to the extent where he couldn’t even retaliate.“Teacher, I’m sorry!”Zhang Yanzong had a dispirited look on his face.“You are only 15, just continue to work hard!’Gu Xiuxun encouraged.“Xuanyuan Po, that Zhou Yao is very strong.She is most probably more powerful than you!”Zhang Yanzong warned.If Xuanyuan Po got the first place of the ‘D’ group, he would be clashing against Zhou Yao.“Watch as I crush her head and avenge you!”Xuanyuan Po slammed his fists together.“…”Zhang Yanzong silently mused that he was warning him out of good will and had no intention of asking Xuanyuan Po to take revenge for him.(Forget it, it’s too tiring to speak to this combat addict.)Very soon, the matches of the ‘D’ group began.“Xuanyuan Po, Ding Yi.Get up on stage!”Tong Yiming announced.“Did I exterminate the Ding Clan in my past life?”Xuanyuan Po scratched his head.“Why is my opponent another person with the surname ‘Ding’?”“Xuanyuan, be careful!”Jiang Leng had a heavy look as he warned.Xuanyuan Po’s opponent’s name was Ding Yi, and Jiang Leng could sense that he was a formidable opponent with just a glance.The two students then got up the stage.Tong Yiming surveyed Ding Yi.He felt better after not seeing spirit runes on the exposed parts of Ding Yi’s body.If not, he would really suspect whether these people with the name ‘Ding’ were here intentionally to make trouble.Actually, the naming convention behind the names ‘Ding Yi, Er, San, Si, Wu (1,2,3,4,5)’ was something very common.This was because the parents of many students weren’t educated nor cultured.Tong Yiming had seen many students with the name of Da Niu (Big Bull) or Gou Dan (Dog Testicle).Ding Yi’s weapon was a three-meter-long halberd.From the looks of it, it weighed at least 100 kg.It was unknown how a 15-year-old could wield it.“Xuanyuan Po, Spirit-refinement realm.Please guide me!”“Ding Yi, Spirit-refinement realm.Please guide me!”After the two of them exchanged greetings, Xuanyuan Po acted like how he usually did and charged straight for Ding Yi.Observing the situation? (This daddy’s style is charging blindly ahead!)Ding Yi stepped back with his right leg and brandished his halberd with a single hand.Dang!The spear clashed against the halberd as an intense clanging sound of metal against metal resounded through the entire battle arena, causing the teeth of the audience to ache as they subconsciously covered their ears.Dang! Dang! Dang!The two of them continued clashing their weapons, neither were moved back a single jot.What was known as a fierce general?This was it!A person blocking the pass against 10,000 enemies!Xuanyuan Po and Ding Yi didn’t use any martial moves.This was a direct clash of strength.The weaker one would be sent flying.“It can’t be, right? The combat addict actually loses in terms of strength?”Zhang Yanzong was shocked.Among his peers, he could be considered a strong man.But when he played arm wrestling with Xuanyuan Po, he couldn’t even last for three breaths.Since Ding Yi’s figure was half-a-head shorter than him and he wasn’t muscular, how was it possible for his strength to be so great?“The boost from his spirit runes is actually so great?”Sun Mo frowned and surveyed Ding Yi.If there were no negative side effects, wouldn’t spirit runes be able to create a large batch of experts easily?Through Divine Sight, Sun Mo actually couldn’t see any hidden dangers on Ding Yi’s body.(Doesn’t that mean that this was a perfect experimental body?)\n"

      "Chapter 619: Xuanyuan Po, Your Acting Skills Are So Exaggerated!Both Xuanyuan Po and Ding Yi were intoxicated as they fought wildly.The cheers of the audience came in waves because this was the most explosive and fascinating match they had ever seen in the entire student battle.The ordinary audience didn’t know how to see the profound aspects of techniques.They preferred watching a head-on clash where fists met flesh.Honestly speaking, it was like some major action films from the United States.There was no need to waste time thinking too much.One could simply eat popcorn, drink soda, and get high.“This Ding Yi seems to look down on Xuanyuan Po!”Tantai Yutang teased.“Ah?”Lu Zhiruo opened her eyes wide and asked in puzzlement, “How can you tell?”“His muscles clearly state that he isn’t someone that focuses on the path of strength, yet he chose to clash with Xuanyuan Po head-on instead of using techniques.Clearly, he is planning to use his body constitution to suppress Xuanyuan Po.”Li Ziqi explained.“Isn’t this a little too brazen?”The papaya girl pouted her lips.After that, she started to shout loudly, “Xuanyuan, you can do it!”“It’s a little brazen, but he does have the capital to do so!”Zhang Yanzong’s lips twitched.Dang!After the long spear and halberd collided again, Xuanyuan Po suddenly punched out, aiming for Ding Yi’s face.Ding Yi smiled malevolently and punched out as well.Bang! Bang! Bang!The fists met, and the qi waves from the impact caused the dust in their surroundings to be blown away.Also, fresh blood could be seen dripping from their fists, but the two of them didn’t frown at all.“Xuanyuan, don’t charge in blindly.Pay attention to your opponent and search for his flaws and weaknesses!”Sun Mo called out.Xuanyuan Po didn’t respond.He stared at Ding Yi, his mind was filled with the thoughts of blasting Ding Yi apart.Sun Mo frowned and shouted again, “Xuanyuan Po, calm down.Don’t fight head-on in such a blind manner anymore!”This time around, a great teacher halo was activated.Its light shone onto Xuanyuan Po.Profound Words!Xuanyuan Po was as though he got hit by a baseball bat and swiftly calmed down.Hua~Those great teachers spectating immediately exclaimed in shock and surprise.“Isn’t this ‘Profound Words’?”“The effects are similar but isn’t Profound Words something only high-ranking great teachers can comprehend? How old is Sun Mo? Why was he able to comprehend this halo now?”“Hence, I loathe those geniuses.They are so strong that they are inhumane!”The great teachers discussed.As Xuanyuan Po’s personal teacher, Sun Mo had the qualifications to provide on-the-spot guidance.Using a great teacher halo wasn’t against the rules.Profound Words would forcibly control the student to act according to their teacher’s instruction.Hence, even if Xuanyuan Po wanted to charge in blindly and fight head-on, he wasn’t able to do so now.He was forced to observe Ding Yi.“Why? You can’t take it anymore?”Ding Yi mocked.Xuanyuan Po didn’t say anything.His life maxim was that when one fought, one should just fight instead of blabbering.However, because he was forced to be calm, he did discover some crucial points.After all, Xuanyuan Po was a genius overflowing with combat talent.“What would you guys do if you were in his shoes?”Sun Mo used the opportunity to ask a question.The papaya girl whom Sun Mo originally looked at immediately dodged to the side.She prayed in her heart that her teacher wouldn’t call her name.After that, her hand involuntarily stretched toward her bag.(I really feel like eating a melon to calm my nerves.)Li Ziqi had many thoughts but because her motor skill was too bad and her combat experience was too little, she couldn’t really tell.“Tantai?”Sun Mo called out.He knew that Jiang Leng understood for sure.“Although I cannot see anything on this Ding Yi’s body, I feel that there are definitely spirit runes hidden beneath his robes.In any case, spirit runes will definitely absorb spirit qi when they are activated.So, Xuanyuan Po just has to attack the parts of Ding Yi’s body where he can sense a large quantity of spirit qi being absorbed.All will be good if he can damage those spirit runes.”Tantai Yutang’s line of thoughts was very clear.Jiang Leng nodded and raised his opinion of the sickly invalid.“Your answer isn’t bad!”Sun Mo praised.“Eh? In that case, we should quickly tell Xuanyuan Po!”Lu Zhiruo urged.“Teacher is waiting for Xuanyuan Po to discover this himself so he can gain some comprehension.This is why he didn’t tell it to him directly.”Li Ziqi explained.For such an experience, if one discovered it themselves, it would be imprinted deeper in their memories compared to others telling them.Gu Xiuxun and Mei Ziyu glanced at Sun Mo, feeling even more admiration for him.Logically speaking, the higher Xuanyuan Po’s ranking, the greater Sun Mo’s fame would be.However, he didn’t care about this.The thing that matters most to him would always be whether his student could grow or not.“Damn, this fellow is so sharp!”Ding Yi was no longer as relaxed as before because Xuanyuan Po started to attack his spirit runes furiously.This caused Ding Yi to be fully focused on the defensive end.Hence, his attacking momentum naturally weakened.In the spectator stands, Bai Wenzhang felt increasingly covetous about Xuanyuan Po.“He is truly a perfect experimental body!”Bai Wenzhang silently praised.But at the same time, he frowned.If the spirit runes on Ding Yi were discovered, those would become his weakness.It seemed that he had to do more research on how to conceal the spirit qi fluctuations.Actually, when Ding Yi absorbed spirit qi, the fluctuations were very weak.Only an opponent like Xuanyuan Po with such sharp senses would be able to discover them.To put it unpleasantly, students who weren’t in the top 64 would just be free points to Ding Yi.Sun Mo observed the battle while feeling admiration for the designer of these spirit runes.The spirit runes were very perfect.There were problems before this because the experimental bodies were too weak.Now that the person was Ding Yi, he was able to maximize the effects of these spirit runes completely.For example, these spirit runes were like an engine while the experimental body was like the materials.For people like Ding Wu, they were considered trash material.Although they could ignite the engine, they would be damaged very swiftly as the probability of wear and tear on them was much higher.But if the materials were Ding Yi, that would be relatively perfect.Bluntly speaking, it still depended on the individual.The better one’s aptitude was, the greater the boost brought by those spirit runes would be.“In that case, it should be possible to create a type of spirit rune that can be tattooed even on ‘trash’ quality students, and it can generate a huge boosting effect.”Sun Mo sank into contemplation, thinking that this research direction wasn’t bad.Upon seeing this scene, the system felt very gratified.Sun Mo wasn’t complacent because he had reached the ancestor-level comprehension in spirit runes.He actually started to take a deeper step to probe the profound mysteries of this field further.For any subject, when someone stood in the lead, they would become the pioneer, giving the later generations a direction.For any subject, the domain of knowledge was slowly explored step by step, gradually expanding, becoming substantial and perfect.Ding!“Congratulations on starting to think about how to advance the field of spirit runes.Reward: 1 silver treasure chest.I hope you will be able to have some achievements in the future!”The system congratulated him.Sun Mo started.There was such an unexpected surprise too?“Sun Mo, I hope that you will become the number one in the field of spirit runes sooner or later!’The system sincerely wished him well from the bottom of its heart.“Thanks!”Sun Mo smiled.However, he had never thought of becoming the best.On the stage, although Xuanyuan Po was suppressing Ding Yi, the battle situation was quite worrisome.Ding Yi’s strength was truly too immense.Besides, his recovery rate was fast.Although he had two broken ribs, they didn’t seem to affect his combat prowess at all.“Xuanyuan, sometimes if you can’t find a path, you should make your own!”Sun Mo guided.It was just like before.Sun Mo wouldn’t directly tell his students what to do.He wanted them to think the problem through themselves, making thinking a habit for them, or even evolving this habit to the instinctive level.“What path? I don’t know what you are talking about!”Xuanyuan Po casually replied.He wasn’t able to defeat Ding Yi despite fighting for such a long time.Was he discouraged? Sorry, that didn’t exist.The combat addict actually wanted nothing more than for Ding Yi to persist longer.However, as the battle entered an impasse, after Xuanyuan Po used his leftover energy to think, he suddenly felt that Sun Mo’s words seemed to be not bad.Didn’t he really look like a headless fly charging in stupidly?“Make a path?”Xuanyuan Po worked hard to think.After that, because he was distracted, the large halberd smashed into his shoulder and the sound of bone cracking rang out.Bang! Bang! Bang!Ding Yi took the opportunity to press the attack.Xuanyuan Po repeatedly retreated.He almost could no longer hold on to Silver Paste.“Eh?”Xuanyuan Po sharply discovered that Ding Yi seemed to be focusing on attacking the silver spear in his hands.(He couldn’t possibly be thinking of knocking my spear away from my hands, right?)(Ze, what a foolish dream!)As he thought of this, Xuanyuan Po fiercely clutched his spear tightly.(Even if I die, I won’t be seperated from my Silver Paste.)(Eh? Wait a minute?)(There seems to be a strategy named ‘beating someone at their own game’?)(I see now!)Xuanyuan Po was a single-celled organism and did whatever he thought of.He basically had never considered what he should do if his battle strategy failed.Hence, he borrowed the great impact from Ding Yi’s next halberd attack and allowed his spear to fly out of his hand.“Oh noooooo!”Xuanyuan Po shouted loudly.He took a large step forward and stretched out his arm to catch the spear.Pak! Pak! Pak!Jiang Leng, Li Ziqi, and the sickly invalid directly lifted their hands to cover their eyes, no longer wanting to watch.(Combat addict, your acting skills are so exaggerated!)“Ah!”Lu Zhiruo was frightened and screamed.She opened her eyes and looked at the silver spear.“Chance!”When Ding Yi saw the spear leaving Xuanyuan Po’s hands, joy appeared on his face.After that, when Xuanyuan Po tried to reach out to grab his long spear, his attack that was originally aimed at Xuanyuan Po shifted to the silver spear instead.At this moment, Xuanyuan Po unleashed one of his ultimate techniques.Presenting Borrowed Flowers to Buddha!Boom!Xuanyuan Po had a solemn look on his face as both his palms blasted toward Ding Yi.“Oh no!”Ding Yi was badly startled, and he quickly pulled his halberd back, wanting to block Xuanyuan Po’s attack.However, it was too late.Bang!The palms of the combat addict solidly smashed into Ding Yi’s chest.After that, Ding Yi was flung through the air and landed outside the stage with a loud bang.Pak!Xuanyuan Po grabbed hold of Silver Paste.After that, he lowered his head in astonishment and looked at his hands.This was the first time he had defeated an opponent using his palms instead of his spear.This feeling felt so strange and so fresh!“Oh yay, he won!”The papaya girl cheered.“I…cough, cough!”Ding Yi coughed up a large mouthful of blood and had a depressed look on his face.He felt reluctant to accept this.Actually, he guessed that it might be a trick when Xuanyuan Po had allowed his spear to leave his hands, but he had felt that there was no way he would lose to a single attack.He just had to send Xuanyuan Po’s spear flying further and he would be able to fight with his halberd against a bare-handed opponent.It would definitely be advantageous for him.“Damn, what the hell was the palm strike? Why was it so fierce?”Ding Yi wanted to cry but no tears were coming out.“Well done!”Sun Mo clapped and praised.“T…teacher, is this victory something that is derived from my superiority in intelligence? I seem to have understood something.”Xuanyuan Po had a pensive look on his face.“Superiority in intelligence, your head!”Ding Yi roared in fury and climbed up to again.(I’m inferior to you? What a joke, fight again with me!)“Xuanyuan Po is the victor for this round!”After Tong Yiming spoke, he looked at Ding Yi.“Please mind your words and behavior!”Xuanyuan Po jumped off the stage and ran back.After that, he saw Jiang Leng and the sickly invalid looking up at the sky.“What’s the matter?”Xuanyuan Po also glanced at the sky.“Something is strange, even the combat addict knows how to use his brain now.I’m checking to see if the sun rose from the west today!”Tantai Yutang laughed.“Mn!”Jiang Leng nodded.“Don’t talk nonsense!”Li Ziqi glared at the sickly invalid before sending her congratulations.“Xuanyuan, congratulations on obtaining another victory!”\n"

      "Chapter 620: Life Tutor, Chicken Soup for the Soul!“I didn’t do anything much.I could win quite relaxingly because my teacher has taught me well!”Xuanyuan Po was someone who didn’t know how to be humble.He was saying this because he truly thought like this.If he had met an enemy like Ding Yi in the past… Even if he could win, he would definitely be heavily injured.And in the worst case, his injuries might be deadly.(Is this the power of intelligence?)This was the first time Xuanyuan Po won a fight via battle strategies.This caused him to feel that it was very interesting.He was also very excited and felt even more admiration for Sun Mo.(As expected, I still have many good things I can learn from Teacher!)Ding!Favorable impression points from Xuanyuan Po +1,000.Respect (5,100/10,000).After hearing the system notification, Sun Mo was a little shocked.Wasn’t the number of favorable impression points a little too high?Sun Mo didn’t know that his guidance today provided an extremely huge impact on Xuanyuan Po.It was like a door to a new world had been opened.“Junior brother, I thought you said that you would only train in your Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique and would ignore all other cultivation arts?”Tantai Yutang teased.“But when you unleashed the palm strike from the Dharma Skyshock Fist, it looked really seasoned!”“I didn’t train much in that!”Xuanyuan Po stroked his silver spear with his finger, looking like he was caressing the face of his wife.“I will not betray Silver Paste!”“So, why would your Presenting Borrowed Flowers to Buddha look so seasoned?”Li Ziqi interjected.“Oh, I’ve seen you guys train in that before.Besides, when Teacher went through the profound secrets of this cultivation art, I was there as well.After listening to it, I naturally knew and understood it.”Xuanyuan Po’s tone was as it should be by rights, but everyone was so depressed that they felt like dying.This was especially so for Li Ziqi.She was gnashing her pearly white teeth and wanted to bite the combat addict.(Are you bragging about your talent?)(Hmph, I will look for you to play chess every day in the future!)(I will make sure to eat all your pieces before checkmating you.)“What sort of monster is this personal student of yours exactly?”Gu Xiuxun was shocked.Intense envy could be seen in her eyes.She knew that the Dharma Skyshock Fist was a peerless saint-tier cultivation art.Usually speaking, the more powerful a cultivation art, the harder it would be to train it.But Xuanyuan Po understood it just after listening to Sun Mo explaining the concepts a few times? Besides, the might he produced when he used that move wasn’t weak.What terrifying talent was this?Cough cough!Tantai Yutang used a handkerchief and covered his mouth.He really felt very envious when he looked at Xuanyuan Po’s body.If he could be so healthy, he would definitely be able to complete his revenge.“Aiya, don’t think so much.Come, let’s eat some melons, let’s eat some melons!”Lu Zhiruo used her hand and cleaved a watermelon before she joyfully passed a piece to everyone.She managed to evade her teacher’s questioning and didn’t lose face.Moreover, her junior martial brothers and sister also won their matches.This was something worthy of celebration!Worthy enough for her to eat a large piece of melon!…During the break time, Sun Mo used the basic massaging technique on Ying Baiwu and the other two.At the same time, he got them to soak in medicinal baths.One couldn’t help but say that the Giant Medicine Packet was really useful when it came to recovering spirit qi for cultivators.After soaking in it for some time, their bodies were adjusted back to their peak states.One could say that after fighting up until now, only Sun Mo’s three personal students were still in tip-top condition.The other students had suffered various degrees of injuries.After all, the competition schedule arranged by the Saint Gate was so tight.It was impossible for everyone to have enough time to recover fully.When the dawn came, the third round of the competition began as scheduled.“I feel that you guys are so shameless!”Gu Xiuxun couldn’t help but tease them after she noticed that Ying Baiwu and the other two were practically glowing with vitality.“Not bad!”Xia Yuan was unable to restrain a smile.“I really feel sorrow for all of your opponents.I estimate that right now, many people would definitely yearn for Teacher Sun’s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands to give them a rejuvenating massage.”Everyone laughed and walked into the entrance of the Westmountain Academy.After that, they were surrounded by a group of youngsters selling information reports.“We won’t be buying any!”Ying Baiwu was deeply afraid that the wastrel princess Li Ziqi might continue to treat gold as dust.Hence, she quickly took the initiative and stepped out, rejecting them all.“We are not here to sell information reports!”“Teacher Sun, can you please guide me a little?”“Esteemed Teacher Sun, please accept a kowtow from me.Can you help me check to see if I have the aptitude for cultivation?”There were a total of 12 youngsters kneeling as they spoke, kowtowing to Sun Mo with great force.“I was wondering why all the information sellers ran to the school’s gate.So, they are waiting for Teacher!”Lu Zhiruo was enlightened.“Did you guys come here after you heard about the matter with the previous information report seller?”“That’s right.”Everyone hurriedly nodded and looked at Sun Mo with anticipation in their eyes.It was as though a single sentence from him could change their fates.When the great teachers passing by saw this, they crowded over and were preparing to admire Sun Mo’s God Hands.“Quiet down!”Sun Mo spoke and looked at these young people.All twelve of them straightened their backs, wanting to give Sun Mo a good impression.“Hmph hmph, when I saw so many information report sellers rushing to the school’s gate, I knew there would be major news.As expected, I managed to spot one.”Li Ruolan complacently aimed the image-recording stone at Sun Mo.At this moment, the carriage with Mei Yazhi and Mei Ziyu within entered the campus.“Move to the side first!”Mei Yazhi instructed her driver as she watched everything with interest.“Who wants to go first?”Sun Mo asked.These youngsters still didn’t know Sun Mo’s personality and were worried they might antagonize him.Their hearts were filled with trepidation.What if he confirmed that they had no aptitude for cultivation?Hence, no one spoke.“You first then!”Sun Mo casually pointed to a youth in hemp garments and walked over.He stretched out his hand and placed it on the youth’s shoulder before forcefully kneaded.The youth in hemp garments momentarily froze, not even daring to breathe loudly.The surrounding great teachers all kept silent and observed seriously.But even when a total of three minutes passed, Sun Mo still hadn’t spoken.Gurgle~The youth in hemp garments gulped down a mouthful of saliva.The trepidation on his face grew increasingly intense.Finally, Sun Mo released his grip.However, he simply looked at the youth and didn’t speak.“T…teacher Sun…”The youth squeezed out a smile that was uglier than him crying.Li Ziqi and Tantai Yutang frowned.Delaying like this didn’t fit their teacher’s behavior at all.Could there be some people with problems among this group of youths?“Sun Mo, just tell him directly whether he has hope or not!”As a great teacher, Gu Xiuxun actually managed to guess Sun Mo’s thoughts.The answer was surely a bad one.This was why Sun Mo had no way to say it out so directly.(Sigh, as expected, Sun Mo is so gentle.Even if the other party is a minor character, he can’t bear to hurt them.)Ding!Favorable impression points from Gu Xiuxun +100.Reverence (20,300/100,000).Sun Mo suddenly heard the notification and cast a bewildered glance at Gu Xiuxun.(Why did you contribute favorable impression points?)(If you surpassed the honest guy and the papaya girl and became my number one point-generator, allowing me to reap a lot of points every day, I would actually feel panic.)“Sun Mo, we understand your gentleness!”Gu Xiuxun patted Sun Mo’s shoulder with an understanding look on her face.“What gentleness? I don’t understand it at all!”Sun Mo shouted in his heart, but the matter before him was more important.Hence, he coughed and adjusted his emotions.“Sorry, you don’t have the talent for cultivation.It’s better for you to work a normal job honestly!”As Sun Mo spoke, the tense atmosphere in the surroundings finally relaxed.The youth in hemp garments started, and his countenance instantly turned pale-white.After that, his body grew soft as he fell onto the ground.“Haha, I’ve always known this.How can a yokel like me have great achievements like other people?”He laughed self-mockingly and then struggled to get into a kneeling position to kowtow to Sun Mo once again.“Many thanks for the golden advice provided by Teacher Sun!”After speaking, the youth in hemp garments trembled as he walked toward the school’s exit.Actually, he shouldn’t have indulged in vain delusion.As a human, it would be for the best if he could see his situation clearly.The surrounding great teachers sighed.In this world, the mediocre would always make up the vast majority.“Next, who will it be?”Sun Mo ignored the youth in hemp garments and continued to ask.The remaining youths didn’t dare to make any sounds.If Sun Mo didn’t speak, it meant that they could still dream about it, but once he said it, they would be the same as the youth in hemp garments.Sun Mo swept his gaze across the kneeling youths and turned his head to call out, “Little bro, can you come back?”The youth in hemp garments didn’t hear it.It was a great teacher beside him who notified him.After he walked back…“What do you plan to do from now on?”Sun Mo asked.“I…from now on…”The youth in hemp garments had a lifeless look in his eyes and chaos in his brains.“Work to keep myself alive.If I’m lucky, I would be able to save a sum of money and marry.”Give birth to a kid?This was something he would never dare to imagine because he wouldn’t be able to afford raising a kid!“Although your talent in cultivation is ordinary, you can have some accomplishments when it comes to weaponsmithing, so what would you do?”Sun Mo asked again.“Ah?”The youth in hemp garments was stunned.Also, Li Ziqi and Tantai Yutang revealed a look of enlightenment.So, their teacher’s purpose was this.“Do you have someone in your family who is a blacksmith? Why don’t you continue working in that blacksmith store?”Sun Mo continued to question.Upon hearing this, the great teachers in the surroundings were stunned.Could God Hands even do this from its sense of touch? Subconsciously, all of them turned to look at the youth in hemp garments.“Say something!”A great teacher with an anxious disposition urged.“Ah? Y…yes!”The youth in hemp garments had never been stared by so many people before.He felt somewhat nervous and afraid.“M…my uncle and my father fell out due to fighting for a small-sized land my grandfather left behind.After that, my father forbade me from working at the smith store.”After he finished speaking, only then did the youth realize that Sun Mo actually knew there were blacksmiths in his family.Wasn’t this too magical?(Wait a minute! Teacher Sun is saying that I have talent in weaponsmithing?)The youth in hemp garments was wildly joyful.Si~The surrounding great teachers all took in a gasp of cold air as they looked at Sun Mo.Was God Hands actually so terrifying?“T…teacher Sun, please guide me!”The youth in hemp garments knelt and kowtowed thrice.“You have some talent in weaponsmithing.You can choose a school and join as an assistant to a weaponsmith.In the future, even if you have no way to forge or refine weapons, it won’t be a problem for you to become an outstanding normal blacksmith.”This data was obtained by Sun Mo through Divine Sight after he analyzed them.“Many thanks Teacher Sun, many thanks Teacher Sun!”The youth in hemp garments excitedly kowtowed to the point where his forehead bled.Ding!Favorable impression points from the youth in hemp garments +1,000.Respect (1,000/10,000).“Teacher Sun, please help me take a look!”“Teacher Sun, I’m begging you!”“You are like my second parent!”After seeing the situation of the youth in hemp garments, the others couldn’t control their excitement and were striving to be the first to be guided.“Silence!”Sun Mo coldly spoke as he lectured in a solemn tone, “If a person wants to change his fate, they need to work hard instead of depending on a sentence from another! Can it be that just because I said you guys have no talent and are destined not to have a good future, you guys are planning to live in mediocrity forever?”“And you!”Sun Mo glanced at the youth in hemp garments.“I gave you a pointer, but once you grow lazy and become discouraged after you encounter a setback, you will still be a failure!”Everyone fell silent.“In life, there are simply too many difficulties.They aren’t something you can just step through because of a sentence from someone.You guys have your own legs.Every time you strive to cross through a setback with your own efforts, you guys will slowly walk to a better life.”After Sun Mo finished speaking, Priceless Advice erupted.Golden motes of light akin to rain cascaded down on everyone soundlessly, moistening them while also bringing warmth, entering their hearts.Everyone started to contemplate.Even those great teachers were no exceptions.“Let’s go!”Mei Yazhi revealed a gratified smile and instructed her carriage driver.Although Sun Mo had just joined the great teacher world, his understanding of the great teacher’s occupation was already relatively deep.Ding!Favorable impression points from Mei Yazhi +100.Friendly (160/1,000).“Eh? We are not watching anymore?”Mei Ziyu felt some reluctance.“If we continue watching, you won’t be able to shift your eyes away.”Mei Yazhi teased.“Mother, stop that!”Mei Ziyu blushed bashfully.Mei Yazhi looked at her daughter, her gaze was as gentle as water.Sun Mo was so outstanding and handsome; he was truly a good match.Sadly, he already had a fiancee.“Mother, do you think those information report sellers have talent?”Mei Ziyu’s brows were furrowed.“Even if half of them had talent, they would also be buried because they had no opportunities, correct? Do you think it’s possible for the Saint Gate to think of a solution to give them an opportunity?”“Silly child, they are all ordinary people.”Mei Yazhi sighed.“Ah?”Mei Ziyu started.However, she was also an intelligent person and soon understood the reason.As expected, Sun Mo was a gentle man.Ding!Favorable impression pints from Mei Ziyu +100.Respect (1,050/10,000).…Sun Mo didn’t provide pointers for the other youths.However, they didn’t forcefully request him anymore because after they heard his words and were illuminated by the glow of Priceless Advice, they had a new understanding of life.Their new understanding was this – never bow down to fate.(If others say I cannot make it, I don’t give a damn.I just have to work hard and do my very best!)The youths kowtowed to Sun Mo again before they left.They were now filled with hope for their future.“Teacher, do you think they will have some accomplishments in the future?”Lu Zhiruo turned her head, feeling very curious.“Senior martial sister, can you be even more naive?”The sickly invalid ridiculed.“Ah?”Lu Zhiruo was surprised.“Did I say something wrong?”“Other than that youth in hemp garments, the other people have no talent.It would be hard for them to have any accomplishments in the future.”Li Ziqi sighed.“Ah?”The papaya girl felt a little bewildered.“Our teacher is really a kind and gentle guy.If those people have talent, Teacher would directly tell them.He is using this round-about method to tactfully encourage them!”Tantai Yutang explained.“Oh, so this is the case?”Lu Zhiruo looked at Sun Mo.“As humans, we should always live for a goal.Since they have no goals, I shall construct one for them.”Sun Mo patted the papaya girl’s head.Many people lived simply for the sake of living on.If they worked a little harder, they would erupt forth with capabilities that they didn’t even know existed in them.Although the youths were now filled to the brim with ‘chicken soup’ and intense fighting will toward life, Sun Mo believed that they would return to their original selves just a year later.“If becoming successful was so easy, wealthy magnates, landlords, high officials, and saints would be everywhere.”Gu Xiuxun shook her head and sighed.Li Ruolan followed behind them.She agreed with Sun Mo’s words.(As expected of a man I admire.I will add 2 more marks for you.)At 9 a.m., the seats in the battle dojo were fully filled.The third round had started!\n"

      "Chapter 621: Mysterious Species of Darkness, Strange Ability!During the third round, after two matches of the ‘A’ group had concluded, Tong Yiming announced the names of two students.Upon hearing the names, the entire battle dojo swiftly erupted forth with cheers and applause.A heavyweight battle would soon start!Sun Mo’s student Jiang Leng vs.Bai Shuang’s student Miao Rui.Bai Shuang had obtained the title of a ‘top graduate’ from the Skyraise Academy of the Nine Greats.She also had very high attainments in the art of spiritual control.And her student Miao Rui was the top-ranked student among this batch in the Skyraise Academy.Comparing fame, Jiang Leng was naturally much less famous.But because of Sun Mo, in addition to how he crushed the powerful Gui Jiarong earlier, he also had a few supporters.“Who do you guys think will win?”“Miao Rui should be a shade superior, right? After all, he is from the Skyraise Academy!”“Yeah, if Bai Shuang encounters something she can’t resolve, she can still seek help for her teacher for the sake of her student.Besides, the opponents sparring against Miao Rui daily are all top-graded students from the Skyraise Academy.”The majority of great teachers looked favorable upon Miao Rui.It was like a boxer who sparred against ten military personnel every day.His training would definitely be more intense compared to other boxers.“Junior martial brother, do your best.After you win, I will treat you to some melons!”Lu Zhiruo waved her little fists.“Could it be that you won’t treat me if I lose?”Jiang Leng countered-asked.“I will still treat you!”The papaya girl was a generous person, but she started after she spoke.In that case, what was the meaning if he won or lost?“Hehe!’After teasing his endearingly silly senior martial sister, Jiang Leng went up the stage.“The two of you, exchange your greetings!’Tong Yiming reminded them.“Jiang Leng, spirit-refinement realm.Please guide me!”Jiang Leng clasped his fists.“Miao Rui, spirit-refinement realm.Please guide me!”After Miao Rui spoke, he laughed.“Let us stop once a clear winner is decided.If one of us can’t win, let us admit defeat cleanly.By doing so, we wouldn’t harm the harmony between us.What does junior brother Jiang think of this suggestion?”Although Bai Shuang lost to Sun Mo in the Great Teachers Battle and had to teach in the Central Province Academy for three years, she had buried the hatchet and had a pretty good impression of Sun Mo now.Hence, Miao Rui didn’t wish to fight too intensely against Jiang Leng as it might cause the relationship between their teachers to stiffen.“Sure!”Jiang Leng nodded.“Let’s get started then?”Miao Rui asked.“Sure!”Jiang Leng pulled out his dagger and waited quietly.“This Miao Rui is very confident in himself!”Tantai Yutang’s lips twitched.“Eh?”Ying Baiwu and Lu Zhiruo were astonished.Why did Tantai Yutang say that?“Only those who are sure they would win would say something like this.Don’t you guys feel that this Miao Rui seems to be very confident in himself? He speaks in an imperious manner like a lofty king peering down on his subjects.”The sickly invalid explained.Ying Baiwu frowned.She originally felt that this Miao Rui, who was quite good looking, was a gentleman.So it turned out that he already thought that he would win this fight.The iron-headed girl grew unhappy upon thinking of this and she directly shouted.“Jiang Leng, crush him!”Ying Baiwu’s cheering was the same as her personality – simple and direct.She wasn’t tactful at all.“Junior brother Jiang, there’s no need for you to wait for me to summon my spiritual beast.It would be unfair to you!”Miao Rui persuaded.Jiang Leng didn’t speak, but he didn’t move as well.“He is also someone with pride!”Bai Shuang mused.Usually speaking when one was fighting against a spiritual controller, they would definitely act first to seize the advantage.If not, if the spiritual controller had summoned their spiritual beast successfully, they would have won half the battle.“Actually, even if you attack now, I won’t be at a disadvantage!”Miao Rui placed his thumb on his mouth and bit the skin before snapping his finger.Pak!The blood from his thumb flew out.Before it landed, it transformed into a ball of red mist.After that, a strange diagram was formed.Boom!The spirit qi in the surroundings started to surge.In the blink of an eye, a basketball-size jellyfish was summoned.It simply floated in the air.Hua~A commotion appeared among the audience as the gazes of tens of thousands of people were drawn to that jellyfish.It was too beautiful and rare.The body of the jellyfish was translucent, hence, one could see the blood flowing within.As its tentacles moved, some motes of light were emitted.“What’s that?”Several people curiously asked.Westmountain was a mountain city.Let alone jellyfish, the citizens had never even seen lobsters and crabs.Their understanding of water creatures was stuck at the chinese perch that they would eat during autumn.“Isn’t this fellow a little too flashy?”Sun Mo was speechless.Such a summoning posture was definitely privately chosen and trained.Bai Shuang had black lines on her face.(How many times have I said that the summoning ritual just has to be simple, direct, and highly efficient? Try your best not to attract the attention of others.Yet, you even snapped your fingers?)“Junior brother Jiang, please!Miao Rui stretched out his right hand and made an inviting gesture, allowing Jiang Leng to attack first.Jiang Leng lunged forward like a hunting leopard and instantly appeared before Miao Rui.After that, his dagger stabbed toward Miao Rui’s throat.The jellyfish that was floating in the air suddenly trembled as a blue-colored bolt of lightning crackled and materialized, shooting toward Jiang Leng.“Ah?”Lu Zhiruo covered her eyes in fright.Jiang Leng dodged.The lightning blasted onto the stage and because of the static electricity, some small arcs of lightning landed on Jiang Leng’s body.Crackle!The second lightning bolt blasted forward.However, this time around, Jiang Leng had sped up and changed his position, shifting around and circling behind Miao Rui.He used Miao Rui’s body to block the jellyfish’s attack.“Impressive!”Upon seeing this scene, Bai Shuang’s eyes brightened as a hint of admiration could be seen on her face.In the past, the majority of the opponents Miao Rui had encountered would choose to temporarily evade the sudden lightning bolts and observe the situation before making a decision.However, this Jiang Leng actually didn’t even want to take a single step back.Such courage was truly shocking.One must know that the pressure brought along by the lightning bolts was extremely immense.“It’s useless!”Miao Rui’s expression also grew heavy.After he spoke, the jellyfish shot out another bolt of lightning, but it actually curved around and avoided Miao Rui, shooting straight toward Jiang Leng.Jiang Leng circled around Miao Rui again and decisively stabbed his dagger toward Miao Rui’s throat.Ding!A long word slanted out and blocked Jiang Leng’s dagger.Crackle!Crackle!The lightning continuously blasted onto the stage, causing fragmented stones to fly about randomly.“Wonderful!”Tong Yiming involuntarily applauded and praised loudly.Because Jiang Leng kept circling around Miao Rui, using the latter as a shield between him and the jellyfish, the lightning bolt always had to curve if it wanted to hit Jiang Leng.The moment the lightning curved, given the amount of time wasted, Jiang Leng would have observed and evaded it.Naturally, some arcs of lightning still bounced onto his body.However, the degree of damage they caused wasn’t severe at all.“Careful!”The papaya girl felt extremely alarmed and scared as she watched the battle.Her palms were already coated in sweat.“What an interesting opponent!”Xuanyuan Po had envy in his eyes.He wanted nothing more than to fight on behalf of Jiang Leng.The situation continued to remain like this for roughly two minutes before Jiang Leng suddenly increased his speed and retreated.He stood at a corner of the stage and maximized the distance between him and Miao Rui.What surprised everyone was that Miao Rui actually didn’t continue to attack.“Miao Rui is as expected of a student from a prestigious school.He is so gentlemanly!”From the viewpoints of some people, Miao Rui could win if he commanded his jellyfish to attack.“There are so many fools!”Li Ziqi’s lips twitched when she heard the discussion.(Do you guys think that the lightning from the jellyfish is unlimited? Clearly, it has used up all its energy.)“However, this Miao Rui is indeed quite impressive.Although he is a spiritual controller, his individual combat strength isn’t weak and he can actually handle Jiang Leng’s rapid attacks.”Gu Xiuxun praised.Pak! Pak! Pak!Applause rang out from the judging panel.The major characters weren’t stingy with their praises as the clashes within these two minutes were truly too fascinating.Their courage, abilities, flow of thoughts, and battle strategies were all clearly displayed.“Are you not afraid?”Miao Rui was curious.Those lightning bolts could even kill a horse instantly, and the arcs of lightning might be small, but if they hit someone, that person would definitely not feel well.However, this youth with the word ‘cripple’ on his forehead didn’t even frown at all.Jiang Leng didn’t reply.He was flexing his wrist.“…”Miao Rui had a meticulous personality and was proficient in guessing things from his opponent’s expression.However, this Jiang Leng was a complete deadman face.(I don’t believe it!)Miao Rui commanded the jellyfish to glance over.Its tentacles sparkled with sparks of lightning as though it was preparing to cast an ultimate attack.Jiang Leng coldly observed.“Junior brother Jiang, if you want to concede, there’s still time.Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that I would be able to hold back enough to show mercy.”Miao Rui persuaded him.Many great teachers were shocked because Miao Rui’s words weren’t an empty threat.They could all sense it was the truth.Because between opponents of relatively equal strength, one would never be able to hold back as they might lose just because of one slight mistake.Hence, they could only go all out.“Life and death are predestined.Student Miao, you don’t have to be bothered with this!”Jiang Leng replied.He used the term ‘student’ instead of following what Miao Rui did and addressing Miao Rui as ‘senior brother’.Even for the sake of etiquette, Jiang Leng wouldn’t call him that because in his heart, only Li Ziqi and the others were his seniors and juniors.Miao Rui started.His expression grew heavy because he understood the coldness exuding from Jiang Leng.(Could it be that this fellow has no emotion?)(But for this round, I’ve won for sure.)Miao Rui took the initiative to attack.His longsword was akin to a shooting star from outer heavens, piercing straight toward Jiang Leng.Jiang Leng waved his dagger and blocked.“Eh? Why is junior martial brother not attacking?”Li Ziqi was surprised.Jiang Leng had always been walking the path of ‘seizing the initiative and attacking first to suppress others’.But this time around, he actually chose to defend passively.“Because he has forgotten the cultivation art he was most proficient in.”Sun Mo explained.“Huh?”Not only Li Ziqi and the others, but even the surrounding examinees glanced over in astonishment when they heard that.“Can someone even forget the cultivation arts they trained in?”Zhang Yanzong was puzzled.Li Ziqi contemplated, “Was it caused by that jellyfish?”“Not bad!”Sun Mo glanced at the jellyfish floating in the air.“Its name is the amnesia jellyfish.It lives in the deep oceans of the Darkness Continent and is extremely rare.It uses lightning bolts to hunt prey and if the lightning bolts failed to kill the prey, it would be able to cause the prey to ‘forget’ its hunting abilities.“The amnesia jellyfish’s lightning bolts have the effects of ‘amnesia’, causing humans to forget their cultivation arts.After all, cultivation arts can be considered a type of hunting ability.”After Sun Mo finished speaking, the people fell into silence.Everyone had a dumbfounded look on their faces.(There’s actually such a species of darkness?)Mother nature was indeed mysterious!“The foundation of the Skyraise Academy is truly deep.They could even obtain such a rare species of darkness!”Sun Mo sighed ruefully.He didn’t feel that Miao Rui would be able to head to the Darkness Continent to capture the amnesia jellyfish given his age and current capabilities.Everyone subconsciously nodded.No one could afford to antagonize such an academy.“Ah?”The papaya girl suddenly cried out in shock, “Doesn’t that mean that junior martial brother Jiang will lose?”[1] Although Miao Rui is referring to Jiang Leng as ‘junior brother’, they don’t study under the same teacher.This is just a respectful term of address.\n"

      "Chapter 622: Sorry, I Didn’t Hold Back Enough and Injured You!The situation on the stage was very clear.Jiang Leng had sunk into passiveness.“What’s going on now?”The audience didn’t understand.Why did Jiang Leng merely assume a defensive posture against Miao Rui?Although he would be able to block temporarily, there was no way he would be able to channel enough strength if he didn’t use any techniques.He would be surrounded by perils.“Jiang Leng, hit him!”Ying Baiwu shouted loudly.(Hehe, he won’t be able to do so!)Miao Rui sneered in his heart.Right now, his confidence was off the charts.He trusted the ability of his amnesia jellyfish.“Junior brother Jiang, the correct method of winning against me isn’t attacking me first.Rather, you should attack the amnesia jellyfish.”Miao Rui guided.Honestly speaking, this couldn’t be counted as Jiang Leng having misjudged the situation.Usually speaking, the close-combat strength of a spiritual controller would be incomparably weaker than their summons.After all, if their summons were weak, who the hell would want to spend time to subdue and train them?However, Miao Rui’s amnesia jellyfish was actually the opposite.Its close-combat strength was extremely weak, but its long-range attack was extremely strong.Given Jiang Leng’s speedy attacks, Miao Rui truly didn’t dare to be certain that he would be able to block all attacks if they were aimed at his jellyfish.“However, it’s already too late to say anything now!”Miao Rui revealed a smile and calmly pierced out with his sword.(I’ve won this battle, aiya, is this action handsome enough?)As his sword pierced out, Miao Rui even had the mood to adjust his direction of attack to flaunt his pose.After all, only handsome guys would be able to get love from the girls!However, at the instant the longsword pierced through Jiang Leng, his body vanished with a swishing sound.“What?”Miao Rui was badly shocked.(How can you still use a cultivation art?) He also realized that there was a high possibility that Jiang Leng might appear behind him.Hence, he leaned forward and exerted force with his leg, wanting to avoid any attacks.Sadly, he was still too slow by half a beat.It was as though Jiang Leng had performed instant teleportation.His shadow flashed and he appeared behind Miao Rui.After that, he ruthlessly stabbed his dagger at the back of Miao Rui’s head.Bang!Miao Rui’s eyes rolled back and he directly fainted.Fresh blood flowed forth like a waterfall, moving down his throat and back, drenching his shirt.Jiang Leng looked at the amnesia jellyfish.Its tentacles were wavering.They instantly dropped down and it pressed itself onto the ground.This was an indication of submission.“The intelligence of this species of darkness is so high!”Ying Baiwu was shocked.(You even know how to avoid calamity and seek fortune?)“For such a rare yet non-extinct species of darkness to survive, it’s definitely no kind soul.”From the mysterious species of darkness encyclopedia he had obtained from the system, Sun Mo knew that on the Darkness Continent, humans were not on the top of the food chain.There were also some mysterious species of darkness that developed their own civilization.“We admit defeat!”Bai Shuang called out and jumped onto the stage, quickly going over to check up on Miao Rui’s injury.“Teacher Bai, I acted in moderation!”If it wasn’t for the fact that his teacher had headhunted Bai Shuang to the Central Province Academy to teach, Jiang Leng would absolutely not explain more given his personality.“Thank you!”Bai Shuang thanked him.As expected, after Tong Yiming had just announced that Jiang Leng was the victor, Miao Rui woke up.He then gritted his teeth in pain.He subconsciously touched the back of his head and felt blood on his hand.“F***!”Miao Rui who always liked to act as a gentleman cursed out loud.Luckily, it was the back of his head.If Jiang Leng hit his face instead, wouldn’t his appearance be damaged? How would he chase after girls in the future?“Sorry, I didn’t hold back enough and injured you.”Jiang Leng apologized.Pu!When they heard this, Li Ziqi and Tantai Yutang burst out into laughter.It was very rare for Jiang Leng to speak, but his toxic tongue skill wasn’t weak at all.He was able to ‘kill’ the moment he spoke.Evidently, he was doing so in reply to Miao Rui’s arrogance before the start of their battle.Miao Rui’s countenance turned dark.“Apologize!”Bai Shuang spoke and rapped her hand on Miao Rui’s head.Pak!“Aiya!”Miao Rui screamed in agony and had a bitter look on his face.“Teacher, I’ve got an injury there.If you continue hitting my head I might become a retard!”“In that case, do you still dare to brag in the future? Don’t assume that others cannot hear the underlying meaning of your words.I’ve long since said that you can be as arrogant as you want to only after you won.But before you win, you have to seriously treat every single opponent!”Bai Shuang lectured, “Your greatest problem is that you assume with the amnesia jellyfish under your control, even if you cannot win, you won’t lose.”“I was wrong!”Miao Rui hurriedly apologized.After that, he looked at Jiang Leng and felt very curious.“Why didn’t you forget your cultivation art?”Honestly speaking, Jiang Leng’s final strike scared Miao Rui.He felt as though Jiang Leng had really teleported.Jiang Leng didn’t speak.“Earlier, you pretended to lose your cultivation art and didn’t use any moves.Was that a battle strategy to lure me in?”Miao Rui continued to ask.He had to make sure he got this answer.After all, the darkness ability of the amnesia jellyfish was his greatest reliance.But now, it was ineffective when facing Jiang Leng.Bai Shuang was also looking at Jiang Leng, waiting for his reply.She was also interested in this.“No!”Jiang Leng shook his head.“…”Miao Rui’s lips twitched silently, musing that he would be a fool to trust Jiang Leng.His deadman face was just too badass.“Do you know many types of cultivation arts then?”Bai Shuang suddenly thought of a possibility.The lightning of the amnesia jellyfish had taken effect, but because the number of times Jiang Leng was hit was simply too little and the number of cultivation arts he knew was too many, he didn’t forget all of them.“Mn!”Jiang Leng nodded.“Is this true? You must be bragging, right?”Miao Rui was shocked.According to his knowledge, Jiang Leng should have temporarily forgotten ten cultivation arts.(How old was this deadman face?)(Did you start learning cultivation arts ever since you were in your mother’s womb?)One must know that the flash had performed by Jiang Leng earlier definitely belonged to a top-graded art.“There’s no solution to it, I have a good teacher!”Jiang Leng turned his head and shrugged.Ah!The gazes of everyone turned to Sun Mo and were filled with envy.“It’s a reality now.The word ‘cripple’ on this youth’s forehead was engraved there for the sake of him acting cool and to lure people into complacency as part of his battle strategy!”“That’s right.In the future, if we encounter people with the word ‘cripple’ on their faces, we must not believe any of them.”“That has to depend on what is the word tattooed on their face.I feel that if someone has the word ‘love’* tattooed on their face, they should be a good person.”The audience discussed fervently, but no matter what, this battle was extremely fascinating and they even saw a mysterious species of darkness.“Teacher, I was lucky to not have disgraced you!”Jiang Leng came back and reported to Sun Mo.“Your excellence already made me speechless.I can only smile!”Sun Mo felt very satisfied.Jiang Leng was indeed one of his personal students that could make him feel at ease.Although he was very quiet usually and had a low sense of existence, if one was to say who was the most reliable among Sun Mo’s students, he was definitely it.The deadman face, who always had no expression, actually revealed a bashful smile this time around.(Being able to receive the recognition of Teacher feels really good!)Ding!Favorable impression points from Jiang Leng +200.Respect (8,700/10,000).“Teacher Sun, where did you obtain all this information from?”Li Ruolan was curious.Earlier, she noticed that even a few of the major characters on the judging panel clearly revealed focused expressions when they saw the amnesia jellyfish.Most probably, they had never seen it before.There was no need to mention the other great teachers.Everyone had been whispering to each other, discussing it.“From books!”Sun Mo’s words were concise and comprehensive.Pu!Gu Xiuxun was unable to restrain her laughter.“…”Li Ruolan suddenly felt like smashing the image-recording stone in her hand into Sun Mo’s head.(No matter what, I’m a rank #11 beauty reporter on the Beauty Rankings, okay? I’m both talented and beautiful.Can it be that my charm is so low?)“That Jiang Leng is so powerful!” Han Xi sighed.“If there’s no accident, the champion would probably be one of Sun Mo’s students!”“Yeah, maybe all three of his students will take the top three!”An examinee beside her involuntarily agreed when he heard this.Sun Mo’s personal students were truly so strong to the point where others could only feel envy.“Teacher, I will defeat them for sure!”Hua Jianmu didn’t want to see his teacher being disappointed and gave a guarantee.“You should try your best to gain more experience for now.In the future, if you encounter them, you might be able to defeat them.But for this time around, just do your best and learn.”Han Xi persuaded.She knew Hua Jianmu’s personality, so she feared that he might really put his life on the line trying to win.If that was the case, he would be courting death.After hearing this, Hua Jiamu’s expression stiffened as an indignant feeling appeared in his heart.He no longer spoke, but he clenched his fists with even more force.“Teacher, just watch me.I will definitely defeat those geniuses and become the champion!”At this moment, Hua Jianmu was brimming with confidence.Even the goddess of luck was on his side, allowing him to find the dawn potion that was extremely valuable and expensive.That was the best proof.(This time around, I will become the most dotted son of heavens!)The competition continued and not long later, it was Ying Baiwu’s turn.Her opponent was none other than Duan Qiao.“The two of you, please exchange greetings!’Tong Yiming reminded them.Duan Qiao glanced at Fang Wuji who was below the stage and felt a little regret.But even so, he cleanly clasped his fist and spoke, “Student Ying, I forfeit!”Hua~A commotion shook the entire scene.But some people realized what was happening because Duan Qiao was Fang Wuji’s personal student.“There’s no need for this.I will defeat you!”Ying Baiwu frowned.She didn’t need a charity like this.Duan Qiao smiled and prepared to walk down the stage.“Wait a minute!”Sun Mo persuaded and then looked at Fang Wuji.“Teacher Fang, you have already forfeited once.There’s no need for your personal student to do the same, right? As a student, they wouldn’t have many opportunities to participate in such a great competition.If he gives up now, it will be too much of a pity.After all, who doesn’t wish to become the champion?”Hua~After hearing Sun Mo’s words, loud sounds of discussion rang out from the crowd.After that, applause followed.Some of them even did a standing ovation.Sun Mo’s character was truly flawless.One must know that if his opponent forfeited, his personal students would be one step closer to becoming the champion.However, Sun Mo didn’t need this.He wanted Fang Wuji to consider more about his student instead.This was the character all good teachers should have.For a time, the waves of favorable impression points were like heavy rain from the sky, flooding his vision.[1] Author making a reference to a character named Gaara (Manga: Naruto), he has the word ‘love’ tattooed on his forehead.\n"

      "Chapter 623: I’m Fighting for My Teacher!Fang Wuji, who had become relatively handsome and was absolutely a dragon among men, knew how noble Sun Mo’s character was.Hence, he didn’t feel surprised when he heard this.“Teacher Sun is truly a role model for all of us!”Fang Wuji sighed.After that, he smiled bitterly and put his hands down.“It’s a pity that I can’t make the decision.”“?”The great teachers were clueless.“Duan Qiao, you have also heard Teacher Sun’s words.Whether to fight or not, you can make your own decision!”Fang Wuji looked at his personal student.“However, I have to say something.Be it in your speech or actions, you should follow your will!”Duan Qiao smiled and bowed to Sun Mo.“Many thanks for Teacher Sun’s advice, but I won’t fight against her!”Like teacher, like disciple.The personalities of Fang Wuji and Duan Qiao were very similar.Because of gratitude, they chose not to act.“There’s really no need for you to do this!”Sun Mo sighed.“Although I understand where you are coming from, the gratitude of my teacher is the same mine.It wouldn’t be too much no matter how I chose to repay it.”Duan Qiao persisted.Upon hearing this, several great teachers applauded and glanced enviously at Fang Wuji.They also wanted such a good student that respected their teachers and ways.“Student Ying doesn’t have to feel conflicted and feel that you won unfairly.I’ve been watching your past battles.Even if I went all out, I don’t dare to guarantee I can win against you!”Duan Qiao persuaded.Logically speaking, young people would be hot-blooded, competitive, and hungry for victory.Their spirits would be reluctant to admit that they were inferior to others.However, Duan Qiao was the same as Fang Wuji.He was polite, exuding a sense of wisdom, farsighted-ness, and amiability.He could admit he was inferior to his opponent in front of everyone.Moreover, his opponent was a female.In a feudal era like this, only someone with a heart vast enough to accept the stares of ridicule from others would be able to do this.“Wait…”Ying Baiwu still wanted to persuade him, but Duan Qiao already jumped off the stage.This indicated that the iron-headed girl won this round.“We must definitely headhunt such a good person to the Central Province Academy!”Sun Mo pondered and was preparing to act.Fang Wuji was the type of staff that was willing to do anything and hated stirring up trouble.He also had no particular request toward his salary.“He has the style of a great teacher!”Li Ruolan evaluated as she looked at the handsome face of Fang Wuji.She originally felt a very good impression toward Fang Wuji, and she wouldn’t reject a dinner invitation if he asked.However, once she thought about the fact that his looks were artificial, she suddenly felt no interest.(No, I like naturally handsome guys like Sun Mo better.)The competition continued.Liu Mubai’s personal student was defeated by Zhou Yao.It wasn’t that Han Zisheng was weak, but rather Zhou Yao was too powerful.“Teacher, I’m sorry!”Han Zisheng lowered his head and felt very disappointed.He wanted to win in the ‘C’ group and fight against Xuanyuan Po to show him who was the best.He didn’t expect he would be eliminated in the third round.“Don’t overthink, you have already done very well!”Liu Mubai actually felt much anticipation for Han Zisheng’s performance.However, he suppressed his unhappiness.“Come, let us analyze the match you fought earlier.”The competition was still very lively.Very soon, it was the ‘D’ group’s turn.“Xuanyuan Po, Hua Jianmu, please get on the stage!”As Tong Yiming announced the names, huge applause rang out from the audience.The tall and muscular combat addict, which resembled a killing machine, had already become one of the most popular figures in the competition.Many gamblers betted heavily on his victory.“Whether I can buy a new luxurious manor next year will be up to you, please win!”“After winning, I will go enjoy drinks at the Spring Fragrance Brothel and if I lose the bet, I will head to the mountains to dig for coal!”“Xuanyuan Po, crush him!”The shouts of the gamblers rang out in waves.Hua Jianmu didn’t expect he would face one of Sun Mo’s personal students so early.After being startled for a short while, he grew excited.He clenched his fists tightly and spoke.“Teacher, I’m going!”(I didn’t expect my chance to rise to fame from a single battle would come so early.)“Be careful!”Han Xi instructed.“Teacher, don’t worry.I definitely can defeat Xuanyuan Po!”Hua Jianmu looked at Han Xi’s haggard face as he guaranteed in a resounding voice.(I will step on Xuanyuan Po, Ying Baiwu, and Jiang Leng to climb to the champion’s throne.)After speaking, Hua Jianmu rushed out.When he got near the stage, he did a beautiful jump and somersaulted onto it.His posture was relatively graceful and caused a lot of people to cheer.Han Xi frowned.She originally wanted to remind Hua Jianmu to forfeit if he could no longer persist as she didn’t want him to suffer any hidden damage that might affect his future.But she was also worried about crushing Hua Jianmu’s confidence.“However, Jianmu’s recent condition seems great.It seems like he belonged to the type where his potential would be ignited under pressure!”Han Xi involuntarily revealed a smile when she looked at her personal student.Maybe, he could really win.Even if he couldn’t win, if he continued to develop like this, he would definitely have great accomplishments in the future.Upon thinking of this, Han Xi shouted.“Jianmu, do your best!”In the past 30 years, Han Xi had been living a very tough and bitter life.One could say that her only reward wasn’t her own capabilities or her identity as a great teacher.Rather, it was because she managed to teach a student like Hua Jianmu.Speaking of judging a student’s potential, Han Xi wasn’t weak in this and had discovered six good students before.Sadly, because she was from very humble origins and had no top-graded cultivation arts, there was no way she could give good cultivation arts to her students.Hence, after her students revealed good talent, they would be headhunted away by a few major characters in her school.Hua Jianmu was the only one who chose to remain by her side.Based on age, Han Xi could be considered pretty old, but she hadn’t married yet.If she was in a village, she would definitely be the target of gossip.However, Han Xi couldn’t care less about all of this.She didn’t want to give birth to a child as the child might have to suffer like she did.Hence, to compensate for that, she treated Hua Jianmu as her very own son as she guided and taught him.Why was Hua Jianmu so thirsty to win glory for Han Xi?His own origins weren’t good.Hua Jianmu, who had always been neglected by his parents, found the care, concern, and love of a family member from Han Xi.Hence, he was willing to follow her unswervingly.“Xuanyuan, be careful!”Li Ziqi reminded her junior martial brother.She could see that Hua Jianmu’s morale was very high and couldn’t help but feel some worry.“It’s just a fight, why is there a need to be careful? Even if I die, it’s all fated!”Xuanyuan Po spoke.His silver spear was balanced on his left shoulder as he walked toward the stage.He had met this opponent before, and Hua Jianmu was a weakling to him.Hence, he wasn’t really excited.Seeing the appearance of the combat addict, Ying Baiwu grew unhappy and shouted loudly.“Xuanyuan Po, put in your 100% to fight.You are fighting for our teacher!”Not only must he win, but he had to win in a beautiful manner.Ding!Favorable impression points from Ying Baiwu +100.(9,600/10,000).“Baiwu!” Sun Mo felt helpless.“You don’t have to think like that!”“Mn!”The iron-headed girl responded, but she evidently didn’t change her thinking.Gu Xiuxun felt incomparably envious when she saw this.Who wouldn’t wish to be regarded with reverence and worship by their students?“Is Sun Mo really that excellent?”Li Ruolan was curious.There were many examples of personal students and their teachers having a good relationship, and this beautiful reporter had seen many of them.But for someone like Ying Baiwu who worshipped their teacher so much, such cases were very rare.Sun Mo was like Ying Baiwu’s mental totem.She looked up to him, worshipped him, and would also defend him!“Could Sun Mo have cast some darkness secret art to brainwash her?”Li Ruolan guessed.She had this thought mainly because Sun Mo was too young.(Leaving aside a secondary saint, I can understand it if you are a highly respected and prestigious 7-star great teacher.However, you have just been a teacher for over a year plus.)“Reporter Li, please refrain from making blind conjectures about my teacher!”Li Ziqi meticulously noticed the gaze Li Ruolan used when she surveyed Sun Mo and gave a warning.“After all, you won’t understand our love for our teacher!’The little sunny egg had no choice but to be cautious.Li Ruolan’s fame was too great and she was a gold-medal main writer that had written an astonishing number of articles before.If she wrote things haphazardly, it would damage her teacher’s reputation.(Ai~)(Teacher, would you lose a piece of flesh if you acted happier when speaking to her, pretending to be awed by her beauty? One must know that women are creatures that can feel hatred easily due to lack of love.)(If you continue ignoring her, she might start writing articles to blacken your name.)But whenever she thought of the fact that her teacher couldn’t be bothered with a rank #11 great beauty on the Beauty Rankings, Li Ziqi would feel very honored.(As expected, my teacher is indeed different from those simps.)Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +100.Reverence(41,460/100,000).Upon hearing the notifications from the system, Sun Mo had a dumbfounded look on his face.(What did I do? Why would you guys suddenly contribute favorable impression points for nothing?)(If you guys continue to act like this, it would cause me to feel a lot of pressure!)“Teacher, eat a melon!”Lu Zhiruo passed over a piece of melon with both hands, choosing the largest, juiciest, and sweetest one!…In the arena.After the two parties exchanged greetings, Hua Jianmu impatiently lunged toward Xuanyuan Po.(Not only must I win, but I have to win cleanly!)Second Month Wind, Willow Fragmented Moon!Hua Jianmu directly used an ultimate skill the moment he attacked.As his swift blade slashed out, a total of 12 strands of blade qi formed and surrounded Xuanyuan Po.“Beautiful!”Xuanyuan Po’s eyes brightened.(Interesting, it seems that he isn’t a salted fish.) Hence, he shook his silver spear and caused several spear flowers to manifest, blocking and dissipating the strands of blade qi with them.Willow Rises with the Wind!Hua Jianmu remained unmoved and continued to take the initiative to attack.All the attacks he used were ultimate skills.“Jianmu, stabilize yourself!”Han Xi furrowed her brows and shouted.It was like the law of conservation for energy.For all cultivation arts, there would be a rule.The more spirit qi consumed by a move, the greater the power would be.Hence, ultimate skills weren’t something one could use whenever they wanted to.They needed to find a good opportunity to do so.The so-called ultimate skills were actually final blows used on an opportunity that would turn the situation your way.What Hua Jianmu was doing now was unleashing many ultimate skills in one go.Other than wasting his spirit qi and stamina, it wouldn’t be too effective.After all, Xuanyuan Po wasn’t a salted fish that would be frightened by the momentum.“Teacher I understand.I’m just displaying my dominance first!”Hua Jianmu replied.As expected, he then stabilized himself and stopped attacking so wildly.“Don’t stop, continue to attack!’Xuanyuan Po was disappointed.The thing he liked the most was a clash between ultimate skills.It felt truly satisfying.“This fellow is very confident in himself and his body is also very strong.Xuanyuan might face some trouble.”Jiang Leng frowned.“Don’t worry, he would at most be injured.In any case, he will win for sure.”The papaya girl felt more confidence in Xuanyuan Po’s combat strength than herself.However, the sickly invalid was focusing intently on Hua Jianmu.He looked at Hua Jianmu’s eyes and then his skin.There seemed to be something wrong with Hua Jianmu’s condition.The battle immediately entered into climax despite the fact it just started.\n"

      "Chapter 624: Transforming into Wind, Ceremony of Death!Xuanyuan Po loved combat.Only during combat would he feel that he was living; only then would he feel that there was meaning in life.Hence, when facing enemies, he had never feared death and would want his enemies to unleash all their moves.He wouldn’t even frown if his enemy unleashed an ultimate move that could kill him.Hence, Xuanyuan Po loved powerful enemies.Even if he got killed, he would feel that it was a fitting ceremony.But today, the combat addict’s brows were furrowed increasingly.“Do you only know these moves?”Xuanyuan Po finally couldn’t bear it and asked out loud.Hua Jianmu’s expression froze, and his countenance turned ashen.Not only did his attacks grow fiercer, but he even roared in anger, “Just these moves are enough to kill you.”Swish~ Swish~ Swish~The swift blade slashed out repeatedly, causing gusts of wind to blow wildly.At this moment, Hua Jianmu even wanted to trade injury for injury.This was because Xuanyuan Po’s careless words had stabbed at his sore spot.Yes, Hua Jianmu only knew these few moves.Even his ultimate skills, which he thought was extremely powerful, was merely an inferior-grade heaven-tier cultivation art.To a genius like Xuanyuan Po, it was completely insufficient.“You definitely won’t be able to do it!”Xuanyuan Po had no other thoughts.He just wanted to tell Hua Jianmu that he needed to use stronger cultivation arts.However, his words made Hua Jianmu so angry that he almost went crazy.“Go to hell!”The Second Month Lancet was a cultivation art his teacher imparted to him.(You are not permitted to speak badly about it.)The combat grew increasingly intense.The two of them would both suffer injuries occasionally and fresh blood would splatter forth.“His body constitution is passable, his courage is passable, and his aptitude is also passable.However, the cultivation art he trains in is too inferior!”Mei Yazhi looked at Hua Jianmu and involuntarily shook her head.This was a good seedling, sadly, his potential was delayed due to various reasons.Naturally, this wasn’t a fault of Han Xi.On the contrary, Han Xi had excavated Hua Jianmu’s potential to the max.Sadly, she also didn’t possess any good cultivation arts.It was like two genius students.One was learning university-level knowledge while the other was learning elementary school knowledge.Twenty years later, the disparity between them would be as great as the distance between heaven and earth.Upon thinking of this, Mei Yazhi sighed deeply.She once wanted to construct some libraries that would provide free access to children of poor families.However, not only did those who felt their benefits being threatened objected, but no one in her clan supported her.After all, knowledge was power.Who would be willing to bequeath that freely to others?What if those people tried to deal with them in the future after they had mastered the knowledge?From then on, Mei Yazhi started to feel depressed and a trace of loathing toward the great teacher world.…“It’s a pity.This student has a powerful constitution, but he has no top-graded cultivation arts and is unable to unleash his talent fully!”Gu Xiuxun sighed.Although Hua Jianmu was fighting very ferociously, he would lose for sure.“I’ve always believed that one cannot choose their birth, but something like cultivation depends on one’s talent and not one’s origin.But from the looks of things now, I am still too naive.”Li Ziqi sighed sorrowfully and felt even more determined to build the largest library in the Nine Provinces.The library she opened shall be opened freely to kids of poor families.“You only know this by now?”Ying Baiwu rolled her eyes.After that, she felt even more gratitude toward Sun Mo.If she didn’t encounter Sun Mo, she would still be struggling in the bottom-most layer of society.Ding!Favorable impression points from Ying Baiwu +500.Reverence (10,100/100,000).Seeing that Hua Jianmu wasn’t able to execute any new moves and all his moves were from low-graded cultivation arts, Xuanyuan Po felt his interest fading.He started his retaliation.Spear Rain Pearflower!Swish! Swish! Swish!Xuanyuan Po unleashed his spear.His attacks were like a violent windstorm as thousands of pear flowers manifested.After that, Hua Jianmu’s clothes became torn and tattered as tens of bloody wounds appeared on his body.Boom!Xuanyuan Po’s silver spear suddenly ignited in flames.He then tossed it out and with a resounding boom, a gigantic flame python was formed.This flame python was seven meters long and it shot straight for Hua Jianmu.The heatwaves flowed forth, and Hua Jianmu felt pain on his face as though it was being roasted.Even all his hair was about to be burned to crisps.He continuously dodged around, but he discovered that the flame snake was following him closely.“Is this the power of a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art?”Hua Jianmu’s countenance paled.However, he gritted his teeth, and his battle intent wasn’t weakened at all.“As expected, it is very powerful.However, I cannot lose.”Bang!Hua Jianmu suddenly halted his steps.He took a deep breath and roared loudly.“BREAK FOR ME!”Hua Jianmu’s swift blade slashed down.This strike resembled a shooting star arcing across the skies as it sliced the head of the snake off.Boom!The flame snake burst into pieces, causing sparks to fill the sky.Hua Jianmu brandished his blade, feeling pride in his heart.He couldn’t help but glance at Han Xi who was below the stage.“Teacher, did you see my performance?”But at this moment, those sparks suddenly exploded.Explode!Xuanyuan Po’s ultimate skill wasn’t so simple.Boom! Boom! Boom!The sparks exploded, forming many fist-sized fireballs.The destructive might of a single fireball wasn’t that great, but with so many together, this destructive force wasn’t something one could belittle.For a time, Hua Jianmu was hit by so many fireballs that he staggered left and right.His entire body was riddled with wounds.Despite him trying to dodge, it was useless as the fireballs were too many.“How miserable!”“That move is so impressive, does anyone know what it is called?”“I think it’s the Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique.It’s a peerless saint-tier cultivation art!”The audience discussed.There were even some who flipped through the information reports to search for an introduction of Xuanyuan Po.After all, his cultivation art wasn’t a secret.“Jianmu!”Han Xi was badly frightened.She could no longer care for Hua Jianmu’s feelings.“Just forfeit!”If he continued fighting, his injuries would only worsen.“Teacher, don’t worry, the might of his ultimate attack isn’t as strong as I imagined!”Hua Jianmu, who had a dust-covered face, grinned.“I can still hold on!”Xuanyuan Po frowned.“Oi, why don’t you know how to appreciate kindness? If my junior martial brother Xuanyuan took the initiative and continued attacking after his ultimate attack, you would have already lost.He didn’t move because he wanted to give you a chance to admit defeat.”Lu Zhiruo shouted, feeling that Hua Jianmu was too much of a braggart.There was no mistake with her words.After Xuanyuan Po unleashed his moves, he stopped and waited for Hua Jianmu to concede.He loved fighting, but he wasn’t fond of killing people or humiliating people for joy.It was a pity that Hua Jianmu didn’t appreciate the kindness.“The battle hasn’t ended, don’t talk blindly about victory and defeat!”Hua Jianmu took a deep breath and started to adjust the entirety of spirit qi in his body, preparing to go all out with his life on the line.He knew that the longer he delayed, the more disadvantageous things would be for him.Hence, he had to win quickly.“Jianmu!”Seeing her student’s appearance, Han Xi no longer knew how to persuade him.In her heart, she felt a deep sense of self-reproach.If she had top-graded cultivation arts, he wouldn’t be forced to be so passive in this match.“Main examiner, are you not stopping this match?”Sun Mo frowned and asked Tong Yiming.Hua Jianmu was clearly putting his life on the line.“Teacher Sun, I understand your worry, but student Hua Jianmu doesn’t have any heavy injuries and is full of vigor.Maybe, he would be able to reverse the situation and gain victory from defeat.”Tong Yiming was also very helpless because it was hard to determine the victor based on the current situation.“Xuanyuan, don’t show mercy!”Seeing Hua Jianmu’s attitude that showed his determination, Sun Mo turned and reminded Xuanyuan Po.If Xuanyuan Po showed mercy and got injured instead, the gains wouldn’t make up for the losses.Actually, Han Xi had the intention to persuade Hua Jianmu to stop.But after hearing Sun Mo’s words, she frowned in unhappiness.(What do you mean by this?)(Do you feel that you will definitely win against us for sure?)After that, Han Xi decided not to say anything.(Even if we can’t win, we will make sure to give you a ruthless bite so you can remember how fierce we are.) This is Han Xi’s way of conducting herself.As his spirit qi circulated around his body with full force, Hua Jianmu suddenly sensed a vast energy suddenly being formed in his Dantian.After that, the energy sprayed forth like a geyser and rushed toward his head and four limbs.Thump! Thump! Thump!Hua Jianmu’s heart suddenly pounded intensely.His six senses became sharper; he could even sense spirit qi particles in the air.“Could it be that my cultivation level increased due to me facing huge pressure?”Hua Jianmu felt joy in his heart.After that, when he looked at Xuanyuan Po, his gaze gradually turned to one of excitement.(Very good, let the pressure squeeze out all my potential.I can win this fight!)BOOM!Spirit qi gushed forth from Hua Jianmu’s body.Because it was too intense, one could only see a cloud of spirit qi enveloping him.Xuanyuan Po had his own pride, hence, he didn’t seize the initiative to attack.Rather, he was waiting for Hua Jianmu to unleash his attack.Yao Guang, who was in disguise and was mingled among the crowd, lost her interest the moment she glanced at Hua Jianmu.She surveyed Xuanyuan Po instead, feeling that something was wrong with this fellow.“Xuanyuan Po, you won’t have the chance even if you want to forfeit now.”After Hua Jianmu finished speaking, he suddenly moved.His entire person vanished from the stage.“Where is he?”Many people were shocked.Their eyes were wide open as they stared around wildly.Only great teachers with good judgment could see that because Hua Jianmu’s speed was so quick, he didn’t even leave behind an afterimage when he moved.Willow Cut, Second Month Falls!Woosh~In that instant, Hua Jianmu transformed into the wind that blew away the winter, welcoming the spring!In fact, even tender shoots of budding greens appeared on the floor of the stage.“Jianmu!”Han Xi’s heart was clenched with worry.As for some of the major characters who were spectating, they stood up in interest.Those tender shoots were formed by spirit qi, indicating that the move Hua Jianmu executed had reached perfection and had no flaws.Woosh~Xuanyuan Po wasn’t scared at all.He charged in valiantly and leaped into the air.After that, he descended rapidly, smashing his weapon at Hua Jianmu.Azure Firefall!Boom!As Xuanyuan Po landed, a ball of flames erupted forth in all directions, akin to a tsunami.The heatwaves caused the examinees in the surroundings to subconsciously retreat.After Hua Jianmu and Xuanyuan Po had an exchange of their ultimate skills, they each brandished their fists and smashed them toward the face of their opponent.Bang! Bang!The two of them were flung backward from the impact.Xuanyuan Po flicked his wrist.His silver spear pierced downward, impaling the stage in a bid to stop his momentum.As for Hua Jianmu, he also thought of dragging his swift blade across the floor, slowing himself down.However, he suddenly discovered that he couldn’t even move a finger.“Jianmu!”At the instant before Hua Jianmu flew out of the stage and landed on the ground, Han Xi rushed over and caught him.Hua Jianmu revealed a bitter smile.He wanted to say that he had still lost and had let her down.But to his horror, he discovered that he couldn’t control his mouth.Also, there was a fishy-smelling liquid flowing out.What was that?Was that fresh blood?Hua Jianmu wanted to take a look, but his neck couldn’t move.In fact, he wasn’t even able to rotate his eyeballs.“Eh? What is Teacher saying? Why can’t I hear anything?”Hua Jianmu could see his teacher crying and howling.He wanted to tell his teacher not to worry because his injuries weren’t serious.After he recovered, he would definitely win when he fought against Xuanyuan Po again.However, why wasn’t he able to say anything?All of a sudden, Hua Jianmu teared up because he understood what was happening to him.Boohoohoo!(Teacher, I’m not afraid of death, but I don’t want to leave you!)Hua Jianmu wanted to lift his hands to grab HanXi’s, but he couldn’t exert any force at all.(You are so poor…Let alone peak-grade cultivation arts, you don’t even have a good weapon.Who would be willing to be your personal student? Hence, I cannot die.If I died, your last student would disappear.)Hua Jianmu struggled and was reluctant.Sadly, sometimes, one was simply so helpless before the machinations of fate!\n"

      "Chapter 625: Sliding Into the Dark Abyss!“Xuanyuan!”Seeing the situation suddenly intensified to the point where life and death could be determined in the next second, Sun Mo was badly shocked.He basically had no time to stop the battle.Now that victory and defeat were decided, Sun Mo instantly rushed out, moving toward Xuanyuan Po.“Teacher, I’m fine!”Xuanyuan Po grinned.He then coughed twice and spat out two mouthfuls of blood.“Don’t speak!”Sun Mo quickly inspected the combat addict’s body.Luckily, his internal organs and bones were only slightly damaged.The injury to his muscles was more serious and if it was someone else, that person probably had to rest in bed for half a year.But with Sun Mo’s God Hands and Xuanyuan Po’s immensely powerful body constitution, he would make a full recovery in half a month.“Teacher, let me do a check-up for senior martial brother?”Ma Zhang was already over 80, yet he still rushed over as soon as he could.“His injuries aren’t serious, you should go and treat Hua Jianmu.”Sun Mo instructed.“Roger!”Ma Zhang had a respectful look on his face.Seeing Ma Zhang’s headful of white hair, Sun Mo still felt a little unacceptable.How did he become the teacher of a highly respected 5-star great teacher?“Junior martial brother, how do you feel?”Li Ziqi and the others rushed over and looked at Xuanyuan Po with worry in their eyes.“I’m fine!”Xuanyuan Po lifted his hand and wiped away the blood from the corner of his lips.“Speaking of which, that final blow from that fellow is so powerful and felt so satisfying.How good would it be if all my opponents are this powerful!”Everyone became speechless.(You are still the same after all, still thinking about fighting despite your current state!)“Junior martial brother, congratulations on obtaining another victory.Come, eat a melon!”Lu Zhiruo passed a large piece of melon to Xuanyuan Po.“Haha!”Xuanyuan Po laughed uproariously and took it.For this match, although the earlier exchanges of blows were boring, that final attack was worth it.Pak!Li Ziqi rapped the back of the papaya girl’s hand.“Don’t act carelessly, he can’t eat anything now!”“Awu!”The papaya girl pouted and felt a little wronged.(If he can’t eat, just ignore it, why do you have to hit me? Also, the melon isn’t in the wrong.This is something I picked carefully, it’s juicy and sweet and definitely delicious.)“I feel that this little fellow can definitely become the spear saint of a generation!”Gu Xiuxun praised.Xuanyuan Po’s fanaticism for fighting was admirable to some extent.On the other side, the atmosphere was the complete opposite.“Jianmu, Jianmu, quickly wake up.Don’t fall asleep!”“Quick, open your eyes!”“The doctor is here.You have to persist, you will surely be fine!”Han Xi shouted loudly.She hugged Hua Jianmu with one hand and held his hand with another.She continuously encouraged him as tears flowed from her eyes.Ma Zhang went over and inspected Hua Jianmu’s body.All of a sudden, he was terrified.Why was his lifeforce withering so quickly?Ma Zhang didn’t dare to be careless and hurriedly took out his silver needles, piercing them into Hua Jianmu’s acupoints.He then took out a medicinal pill used for emergencies and stuffed it into his mouth.Cough! Cough!Hua Jianmu coughed, his gaze slackened.He wanted to look for Han Xi and grab hold of her hands.“I’m here!”Han Xi endured the urge to cry, not wanting Hua Jianmu to worry.“T…teacher, I’m s…sorry.I m…might not be a…able to s… see the day w…where you become a s…saint.”“Don’t speak anymore, these minor injuries are small issues.Once you are healed, we will go and look for a more powerful cultivation art.When the 4-star great teacher examination comes, I will be waiting with anticipation for you to become the champion in the student battle, ascending to the Heros Ranking with glory!”Han Xi encouraged.She then saw Hua Jianmu continuously coughing out blood clots.She stared at Ma Zhang in panic.“What’s going on? Why is he still bleeding?”Ma Zhang hesitated, not knowing what to say.This was like a final radiance of the setting sun, Hua Jianmu’s final bit of lucidity before he died.There was no more hope in saving him.“I…feel so much r…regret that I can’t watch as Teacher shoots t…to fame over the world!”Hua Jianmu breathed his last after finishing his words.“Jianmu! Jianmu! Wake up!”Han Xi was going crazy with anxiousness.“Great Teacher Ma, I’m begging you.Please save him, please save him!”Ma Zhang felt very bad.He didn’t know how to console Han Xi.However, the doctor beside him wasn’t so emotional.In a student battle, although someone dying was not common, it wasn’t that there were no precedents.Besides, Hua Jianmu had nothing to do with them!“Teacher Han, my condolences.He is dead!”After a doctor spoke, he was glared ruthlessly by Han Xi.“SHUT UP!”Han Xi roared.“Fine!”After seeing Han Xi’s appearance, that doctor’s lips twitched and he couldn’t be bothered with her anymore.“Teacher!”Li Ziqi had been paying attention to Hua Jianmu’s situation.Upon hearing this, she silently jabbed Sun Mo’s arm.“Teacher, Hua Jianmu seems to be dead.”“He’s dead?”Sun Mo was startled.He hurriedly stood up and rushed over.“Teacher Ma, how is it?”As he spoke, Sun Mo squatted down and stretched out his hand to inspect.After that, his brows became tightly furrowed.Ma Zhang shook his head.“Teacher Sun, how are things?”Tong Yiming asked in a low voice.Sun Mo didn’t reply in consideration of Han Xi’s feelings.He merely shook his head.“Teacher Han, please accept my condolences!”Tong Yiming’s tone was filled with pain.He was the main examiner and although he understood Han Xi’s feelings, there were still matches to be fought.Besides, it was impossible to let the corpse remain here.Just a short while later, the audience was already making noises.In fact, some who loved drama were even charging forward.Since Hua Jianmu was already confirmed to be dead, the authorities should quickly remove his body.“You are talking nonsense, my student isn’t dead!”When Han Xi heard this, she directly stretched out her hand and pushed Sun Mo away.“Don’t you touch him.”“Teacher Han!”Ma Zhang didn’t mind if he was slighted, but when he saw his teacher was being treated impolitely, he wasn’t able to endure it.Hence, his tone was filled with reproach.“Forget it, it’s fine!”Sun Mo stopped him.He could understand Han Xi’s emotions.Right now, she was suffering from a very great impact and wouldn’t believe in the judgment of others.Only by acting like this would she be able to protect the last bit of hope in her heart.The major characters on the judging panel also rushed over.“Teacher Han, please restrain your grief!”“No one would feel good when a thing like this happened.”“Student Hua performed outstandingly.He is worthy of us feeling pride for him!”Liang Hongda and the others persuaded Han Xi, but their words sounded extremely ear-piercing to her.This was especially so for the scene before her eyes!When her student was alive, she wouldn’t even have the chance to approach a major character.Now that he was dead, he actually received their ‘pride’ and ‘concern’.(Hehe!)(Do you guys really care for Hua Jianmu? You are merely safeguarding your own esteemed and respectful appearance.If this wasn’t in the public’s eye, would any of you care about the life and death of a student you have never heard before?)(How comical!)Han Xi coldly smiled, she only felt that these great teachers had disgusting and repulsive countenances.After that, she gazed toward Hua Jianmu’s face that had lost all its color, and she sank into a deep pit of self-blame.“I should have stopped you! It’s all my fault!”“If I had a top-grade cultivation art to impart to you, you wouldn’t have died!”“This is all because of me.I was from a humble origin, yet I sought to rise above my station in life, wanting to become a great teacher.How ridiculous!”Han Xi carried Hua Jianmu and sobbed as she continuously apologized to him.Liang Hongda glanced at Tong Yiming, signaling for him to resolve everything quickly.Tong Yiming spread his hands.(What can I do? I’m also very helpless!)Ma Zhang stood up, there was already no need for her to do anything.But when he heard Han Xi’s sobbing as well as looking at her unconvinced expression, he decided to say a sentence.“Teacher Han, Student Hua might have died, but this has nothing to do with my senior martial brother Xuanyuan.Student Hua died due to his life potential being exhausted!”Ma Zhang spoke out of good will and his character was pure.He addressed Xuanyuan Po as his senior martial brother simply because he would join Sun Mo’s tutelage later.He had no other meanings.However, these words infuriated Han Xi when she heard them.“What do you mean?” Han Xi asked.“Am I someone with such a narrow state of heart?”Honestly speaking, Han Xi hated Xuanyuan Po, but it wasn’t to the extent where she would find trouble for him.After all, this was a fair fight.“Eh!”Ma Zhang was at a loss for words.He was actually worried that Han Xi might place this debt on Sun Mo or Xuanyuan Po.Now that he was being questioned, he felt somewhat embarrassed.Hence, he attempted to explain more.“Earlier in the fight, Student Hua exerted too much spirit qi and during times of insufficiency, his life potential was consumed.This is not normal, and it must be because of a problematic effect of a cultivation art or a problem occurred with something he consumed.”After Ma Zhang spoke, the gazes of the surrounding great teachers became profound as they silently contemplated.“What do you wish to say?”Han Xi carried Hua Jianmu and stood up directly, staring angrily at Ma Zhang.(My student has already died, yet you still want to sully him?)“What do you mean by a problematic effect of a cultivation art or a problem occurred with something he consumed? Are you trying to say that we are adopting improper methods for the sake of achieving victory?”“Eh!”Ma Zhang scratched his head, feeling a headache.He only knew how to analyze medical facts.It was too hard to interact and communicate in a tactful manner with other people.“Speak clearly, what do you mean?”Han Xi continued to press on.Her student had already died.If he couldn’t even have the last bit of innocence in his death, what sort of personal teacher could she count for? She might as well just bang her head into a wall to kill herself.“I’ve misspoken.”Ultimately, Ma Zhang was a good man and also had the demeanor of a high-ranking great teacher.The student had died, so there was no need to let the teacher suffer all this unwanted gossip.Hence, he apologized.Sun Mo didn’t want trouble, but Ma Zhang was ultimately still his student.Also, when he saw an old man like him being blasted like this, he couldn’t help but interject.“Student Hua should have consumed a bottle of medicine around night time roughly four days before this…”“Teacher!”Ma Zhang looked at Sun Mo.“I understand your feelings of wanting to protect your student’s reputation, but there’s a possibility that he might have hidden this matter from you.Besides, it’s better to make things clear for situations like this!”Sun Mo had another thought in mind, hoping that Han Xi’s guilt toward Hua Jianmu might be lessened after hearing about his actions.“That thing he consumed gave him a huge improvement, but it also squeezed out all his life potential and claimed his life.”The entire surroundings were in an uproar after Sun Mo finished speaking.“Hua Jianmu drank medicine?”The great teachers whispered to each other.In the student battle, it was permitted for students to use items that could upgrade their combat strength.Things like potions and spirit runes were all allowed, but the prerequisite was that these items must be prepared by their personal teachers.After all, this was the great teacher examination, as long as the personal teachers were the ones to provide the items, it would be accepted.However, Han Xi actually had no idea that Hua Jianmu consumed medicine.This accident didn’t seem ordinary.As for doubting whether Sun Mo was lying?Please, leaving aside how amazing his God Hands were, there were also so many doctors here who could prove the fact.Why would Sun Mo slander Han Xi for no reason at all?One must know that Sun Mo’s student was the victor.He could just ignore everything and watch the show, but he was bringing this up because of Han Xi’s attitude toward Ma Zhang.“You are farting!”Han Xi roared in rage.With a woosh, she pulled out her swift blade.“I want to fight you!”\n"

      "Chapter 625: Sliding Into the Dark Abyss!“Xuanyuan!”Seeing the situation suddenly intensified to the point where life and death could be determined in the next second, Sun Mo was badly shocked.He basically had no time to stop the battle.Now that victory and defeat were decided, Sun Mo instantly rushed out, moving toward Xuanyuan Po.“Teacher, I’m fine!”Xuanyuan Po grinned.He then coughed twice and spat out two mouthfuls of blood.“Don’t speak!”Sun Mo quickly inspected the combat addict’s body.Luckily, his internal organs and bones were only slightly damaged.The injury to his muscles was more serious and if it was someone else, that person probably had to rest in bed for half a year.But with Sun Mo’s God Hands and Xuanyuan Po’s immensely powerful body constitution, he would make a full recovery in half a month.“Teacher, let me do a check-up for senior martial brother?”Ma Zhang was already over 80, yet he still rushed over as soon as he could.“His injuries aren’t serious, you should go and treat Hua Jianmu.”Sun Mo instructed.“Roger!”Ma Zhang had a respectful look on his face.Seeing Ma Zhang’s headful of white hair, Sun Mo still felt a little unacceptable.How did he become the teacher of a highly respected 5-star great teacher?“Junior martial brother, how do you feel?”Li Ziqi and the others rushed over and looked at Xuanyuan Po with worry in their eyes.“I’m fine!”Xuanyuan Po lifted his hand and wiped away the blood from the corner of his lips.“Speaking of which, that final blow from that fellow is so powerful and felt so satisfying.How good would it be if all my opponents are this powerful!”Everyone became speechless.(You are still the same after all, still thinking about fighting despite your current state!)“Junior martial brother, congratulations on obtaining another victory.Come, eat a melon!”Lu Zhiruo passed a large piece of melon to Xuanyuan Po.“Haha!”Xuanyuan Po laughed uproariously and took it.For this match, although the earlier exchanges of blows were boring, that final attack was worth it.Pak!Li Ziqi rapped the back of the papaya girl’s hand.“Don’t act carelessly, he can’t eat anything now!”“Awu!”The papaya girl pouted and felt a little wronged.(If he can’t eat, just ignore it, why do you have to hit me? Also, the melon isn’t in the wrong.This is something I picked carefully, it’s juicy and sweet and definitely delicious.)“I feel that this little fellow can definitely become the spear saint of a generation!”Gu Xiuxun praised.Xuanyuan Po’s fanaticism for fighting was admirable to some extent.On the other side, the atmosphere was the complete opposite.“Jianmu, Jianmu, quickly wake up.Don’t fall asleep!”“Quick, open your eyes!”“The doctor is here.You have to persist, you will surely be fine!”Han Xi shouted loudly.She hugged Hua Jianmu with one hand and held his hand with another.She continuously encouraged him as tears flowed from her eyes.Ma Zhang went over and inspected Hua Jianmu’s body.All of a sudden, he was terrified.Why was his lifeforce withering so quickly?Ma Zhang didn’t dare to be careless and hurriedly took out his silver needles, piercing them into Hua Jianmu’s acupoints.He then took out a medicinal pill used for emergencies and stuffed it into his mouth.Cough! Cough!Hua Jianmu coughed, his gaze slackened.He wanted to look for Han Xi and grab hold of her hands.“I’m here!”Han Xi endured the urge to cry, not wanting Hua Jianmu to worry.“T…teacher, I’m s…sorry.I m…might not be a…able to s… see the day w…where you become a s…saint.”“Don’t speak anymore, these minor injuries are small issues.Once you are healed, we will go and look for a more powerful cultivation art.When the 4-star great teacher examination comes, I will be waiting with anticipation for you to become the champion in the student battle, ascending to the Heros Ranking with glory!”Han Xi encouraged.She then saw Hua Jianmu continuously coughing out blood clots.She stared at Ma Zhang in panic.“What’s going on? Why is he still bleeding?”Ma Zhang hesitated, not knowing what to say.This was like a final radiance of the setting sun, Hua Jianmu’s final bit of lucidity before he died.There was no more hope in saving him.“I…feel so much r…regret that I can’t watch as Teacher shoots t…to fame over the world!”Hua Jianmu breathed his last after finishing his words.“Jianmu! Jianmu! Wake up!”Han Xi was going crazy with anxiousness.“Great Teacher Ma, I’m begging you.Please save him, please save him!”Ma Zhang felt very bad.He didn’t know how to console Han Xi.However, the doctor beside him wasn’t so emotional.In a student battle, although someone dying was not common, it wasn’t that there were no precedents.Besides, Hua Jianmu had nothing to do with them!“Teacher Han, my condolences.He is dead!”After a doctor spoke, he was glared ruthlessly by Han Xi.“SHUT UP!”Han Xi roared.“Fine!”After seeing Han Xi’s appearance, that doctor’s lips twitched and he couldn’t be bothered with her anymore.“Teacher!”Li Ziqi had been paying attention to Hua Jianmu’s situation.Upon hearing this, she silently jabbed Sun Mo’s arm.“Teacher, Hua Jianmu seems to be dead.”“He’s dead?”Sun Mo was startled.He hurriedly stood up and rushed over.“Teacher Ma, how is it?”As he spoke, Sun Mo squatted down and stretched out his hand to inspect.After that, his brows became tightly furrowed.Ma Zhang shook his head.“Teacher Sun, how are things?”Tong Yiming asked in a low voice.Sun Mo didn’t reply in consideration of Han Xi’s feelings.He merely shook his head.“Teacher Han, please accept my condolences!”Tong Yiming’s tone was filled with pain.He was the main examiner and although he understood Han Xi’s feelings, there were still matches to be fought.Besides, it was impossible to let the corpse remain here.Just a short while later, the audience was already making noises.In fact, some who loved drama were even charging forward.Since Hua Jianmu was already confirmed to be dead, the authorities should quickly remove his body.“You are talking nonsense, my student isn’t dead!”When Han Xi heard this, she directly stretched out her hand and pushed Sun Mo away.“Don’t you touch him.”“Teacher Han!”Ma Zhang didn’t mind if he was slighted, but when he saw his teacher was being treated impolitely, he wasn’t able to endure it.Hence, his tone was filled with reproach.“Forget it, it’s fine!”Sun Mo stopped him.He could understand Han Xi’s emotions.Right now, she was suffering from a very great impact and wouldn’t believe in the judgment of others.Only by acting like this would she be able to protect the last bit of hope in her heart.The major characters on the judging panel also rushed over.“Teacher Han, please restrain your grief!”“No one would feel good when a thing like this happened.”“Student Hua performed outstandingly.He is worthy of us feeling pride for him!”Liang Hongda and the others persuaded Han Xi, but their words sounded extremely ear-piercing to her.This was especially so for the scene before her eyes!When her student was alive, she wouldn’t even have the chance to approach a major character.Now that he was dead, he actually received their ‘pride’ and ‘concern’.(Hehe!)(Do you guys really care for Hua Jianmu? You are merely safeguarding your own esteemed and respectful appearance.If this wasn’t in the public’s eye, would any of you care about the life and death of a student you have never heard before?)(How comical!)Han Xi coldly smiled, she only felt that these great teachers had disgusting and repulsive countenances.After that, she gazed toward Hua Jianmu’s face that had lost all its color, and she sank into a deep pit of self-blame.“I should have stopped you! It’s all my fault!”“If I had a top-grade cultivation art to impart to you, you wouldn’t have died!”“This is all because of me.I was from a humble origin, yet I sought to rise above my station in life, wanting to become a great teacher.How ridiculous!”Han Xi carried Hua Jianmu and sobbed as she continuously apologized to him.Liang Hongda glanced at Tong Yiming, signaling for him to resolve everything quickly.Tong Yiming spread his hands.(What can I do? I’m also very helpless!)Ma Zhang stood up, there was already no need for her to do anything.But when he heard Han Xi’s sobbing as well as looking at her unconvinced expression, he decided to say a sentence.“Teacher Han, Student Hua might have died, but this has nothing to do with my senior martial brother Xuanyuan.Student Hua died due to his life potential being exhausted!”Ma Zhang spoke out of good will and his character was pure.He addressed Xuanyuan Po as his senior martial brother simply because he would join Sun Mo’s tutelage later.He had no other meanings.However, these words infuriated Han Xi when she heard them.“What do you mean?” Han Xi asked.“Am I someone with such a narrow state of heart?”Honestly speaking, Han Xi hated Xuanyuan Po, but it wasn’t to the extent where she would find trouble for him.After all, this was a fair fight.“Eh!”Ma Zhang was at a loss for words.He was actually worried that Han Xi might place this debt on Sun Mo or Xuanyuan Po.Now that he was being questioned, he felt somewhat embarrassed.Hence, he attempted to explain more.“Earlier in the fight, Student Hua exerted too much spirit qi and during times of insufficiency, his life potential was consumed.This is not normal, and it must be because of a problematic effect of a cultivation art or a problem occurred with something he consumed.”After Ma Zhang spoke, the gazes of the surrounding great teachers became profound as they silently contemplated.“What do you wish to say?”Han Xi carried Hua Jianmu and stood up directly, staring angrily at Ma Zhang.(My student has already died, yet you still want to sully him?)“What do you mean by a problematic effect of a cultivation art or a problem occurred with something he consumed? Are you trying to say that we are adopting improper methods for the sake of achieving victory?”“Eh!”Ma Zhang scratched his head, feeling a headache.He only knew how to analyze medical facts.It was too hard to interact and communicate in a tactful manner with other people.“Speak clearly, what do you mean?”Han Xi continued to press on.Her student had already died.If he couldn’t even have the last bit of innocence in his death, what sort of personal teacher could she count for? She might as well just bang her head into a wall to kill herself.“I’ve misspoken.”Ultimately, Ma Zhang was a good man and also had the demeanor of a high-ranking great teacher.The student had died, so there was no need to let the teacher suffer all this unwanted gossip.Hence, he apologized.Sun Mo didn’t want trouble, but Ma Zhang was ultimately still his student.Also, when he saw an old man like him being blasted like this, he couldn’t help but interject.“Student Hua should have consumed a bottle of medicine around night time roughly four days before this…”“Teacher!”Ma Zhang looked at Sun Mo.“I understand your feelings of wanting to protect your student’s reputation, but there’s a possibility that he might have hidden this matter from you.Besides, it’s better to make things clear for situations like this!”Sun Mo had another thought in mind, hoping that Han Xi’s guilt toward Hua Jianmu might be lessened after hearing about his actions.“That thing he consumed gave him a huge improvement, but it also squeezed out all his life potential and claimed his life.”The entire surroundings were in an uproar after Sun Mo finished speaking.“Hua Jianmu drank medicine?”The great teachers whispered to each other.In the student battle, it was permitted for students to use items that could upgrade their combat strength.Things like potions and spirit runes were all allowed, but the prerequisite was that these items must be prepared by their personal teachers.After all, this was the great teacher examination, as long as the personal teachers were the ones to provide the items, it would be accepted.However, Han Xi actually had no idea that Hua Jianmu consumed medicine.This accident didn’t seem ordinary.As for doubting whether Sun Mo was lying?Please, leaving aside how amazing his God Hands were, there were also so many doctors here who could prove the fact.Why would Sun Mo slander Han Xi for no reason at all?One must know that Sun Mo’s student was the victor.He could just ignore everything and watch the show, but he was bringing this up because of Han Xi’s attitude toward Ma Zhang.“You are farting!”Han Xi roared in rage.With a woosh, she pulled out her swift blade.“I want to fight you!”\n"
