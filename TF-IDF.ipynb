      "Chapter 626: Dark Great Teacher On the stage, Yao Guang watched the conflict below with interest.“That Han Xi definitely is embittered and hates the world.She must be feeling that the whole world is against her, right?”Yao Guang’s lips curled.She could understand Han Xi’s grievance.Her own students were poached away one by one.The only one that remained behind, the one that bonded with her for life, also died here.As his teacher, she naturally had to seek justice for him.Hence, even though she knew she wouldn’t be able to win against Sun Mo, she had to fight.“Truly a good teacher that loves her student!”Yao Guang sighed ruefully.One must know that this was a life-and-death battle where one could really die.Given Sun Mo’s strength, he was able to crush her 100 times.“Ze, what a pity that your student is trash!”Yao Guang felt some regret.She glanced at Hua Jianmu’s corpse with a disdainful look on her face.“Unable to defeat Xuanyuan Po even after drinking that potion.This is really a case of giving him the opportunity, yet he is still useless!”“Are you the one who did it?”A voice suddenly rang out.“Starlord Sir!”Yao Guang smiled.“Yes, I was the one who set the whole thing up.I could kill three birds with one stone by testing the battle god potion’s effect while checking the standard of Sun Mo’s student.In the end, our side might even be able to gain a great teacher with extraordinary potential!”“There are many other solutions if you wish to headhunt someone.You should stop using such cruel methods!”The Daybreak Starlord looked at Han Xi and had a calm look on his face.It was unknown what he was thinking about.“Yo, the once cruel and ruthless Daybreak Starlord actually starts to pity people?”Yao Guang feigned astonishment.“Hehe!”The Daybreak Starlord shook his head and left the battle dojo.“Eh? Sir, are you not going to watch her battle against Sun Mo? Maybe, her shocking potential might erupt.Sigh, if I knew this would happen, I would have given her a bottle of battle god potion too!”Yao Guang felt regret.Hua Jianmu was too naive.It was all due to Yao Guang’s scheme that he had picked up that ‘dawn potion’.He was merely a 15-year-old youth and wouldn’t know of the many evils in the world.“The fight won’t happen!”The Daybreak Starlord glanced at Sun Mo.Although he wasn’t acquainted with Sun Mo, he knew this young man definitely wouldn’t attack.…“Teacher Sun, calm down!”Mei Yazhi persuaded and personally squatted beside Hua Jianmu to inspect his body.Although she wasn’t a doctor, she was an alchemy grandmaster and also had a thorough understanding of the human body’s condition.“Mn!”Sun Mo nodded.He glanced at Han Xi and then turned to leave without saying anything.As for fighting Han Xi? He would definitely not accept this.Upon seeing this, the crowd was in an uproar.The great teachers were once again impressed by Sun Mo’s magnanimity.One must know that if Sun Mo didn’t retaliate, it was equivalent to him admitting that he was speaking nonsense.This scene happened under the eyes of over 30,000 people.The few who were jealous of him would definitely damage his reputation just by casually spreading this around.However, Sun Mo didn’t mind.How good was his character?For a time, the favorable impression points Sun Mo obtained exceeded over 10,000.Sun Mo was astonished when he heard the notification, not thinking that there would be such an unexpected reward.He purely didn’t want to stress out Han Xi even more, seeing how bitter her fate was.Mei Yazhi glanced at Sun Mo and her impression of him grew even better.“Teacher, what’s going on exactly?”Li Ziqi frowned.“He drank a type of potion that overdrafted his life potential!”Sun Mo lowered his voice.“Let’s put it this way.The potential of an ordinary individual would slowly be unleashed through a long process of growth.As for Hua Jianmu, all his potential was forced out in a short period, and his body wasn’t able to withstand the burden.Hence, he died.“Everyone is like a piece of firewood, while life is the fire burning it.But the firewood representing Hua Jianmu was all burned up in an instant.”Ma Zhang explained.After that, he apologized to Sun Mo, “Teacher, sorry.I’ve made her wrong you.”“Don’t worry about it!”Sun Mo waved his hands.He wasn’t just a man; he was also a great teacher.He naturally had this bit of magnanimity.“Teacher is so magnanimous!”The three crazy fangirls felt worship for him.A few minutes later, after Mei Yazhi finished her inspection, she consoled Han Xi.“Keep his body first.It is a type of blasphemy to leave his body there to be stared at by the spectators!”When Han Xi heard this, her tears that had stopped began to flow down her face again.Someone offered to help.“No need!”Han Xi rejected.She personally carried Hua Jianmu’s corpse and walked unsteadily away, leaving the battle dojo.“Follow her, help her if she needs help!”Mei Yazhi instructed her personal student.She could see that there was a problem with Hua Jianmu’s body, but this scene clearly wasn’t suitable for her to dig too deeply.It was better to wait for Han Xi to calm down before speaking detailedly with her!…Outside the dojo, the sun shone brilliantly, yet Han Xi felt that her entire body was cold.It was as though it was currently a cold night in winter!Looking at the young girls and boys brimming with vitality as they moved about the campus, Han Xi subconsciously tightened her hold on Hua Jianmu whose countenance had turned pale.Hua Jianmu’s corpse that gradually turned cold was as though this world was currently losing its warmth.It also caused Han Xi’s heart to be sealed in ice.“Do you feel that the world is full of maliciousness toward you and your student?”A middle-aged man appeared beside Han Xi.He had a bamboo tube in his hand and was leisurely biting on a barley straw as he drank soy milk.Han Xi ignored him.“Others are enjoying fresh flowers and applause, but the two of you are like defeated dogs who are down and out.You all only want to gain some fame and achievements.Yet, your student has lost his life.”The middle-aged man sighed.Swish~A swift blade slashed over, but it was unknown what happened as it got repelled.The counter was so fast that Han Xi didn’t even see it clearly.If it was any other time, Han Xu would retreat and remain cautious.But today, she no longer cared.She stared angrily at the middle-aged man, and she was like a fighting dog that had just gotten injured.Pak!A bamboo tube landed on Hua Jianmu’s body.Han Xi’s gaze involuntarily turned over because the bamboo tube showed signs of being burned before.From its motley color, it was clear that it was old.However, the diagram engraved on the bamboo tube was slowly moving.Even a fool could see that it was a secret treasure.“This is the Four Phases Sword Cannon.Treat this as a meeting gift from me to you.”The middle-aged man smiled.Han Xi didn’t take it.The middle-aged man’s lips twitched.“I truly cannot take out average-grade saint-tier cultivation arts freely, but I only have this with me“Oh right, although you are trained in the art of blade for twelve years, let me persuade you a little to change to the sword.You don’t have any future when it comes to using blades.”The middle-aged man sighed.He knew that Han Xi chose to practice the blade simply because out of all the cultivation arts she had, the grade of the Second Month Lancet was the highest.It wasn’t because she was fond of blades.“Who are you?”Han Xi’s eyes narrowed.An average-grade saint-tier cultivation art? Who would use such a thing as a meeting gift? It was unknown why, but when she looked at the clear and deep eyes of this man, she instinctively felt that he wasn’t lying.However, what shocked her the most was his guidance.He accurately spoke out that she was practicing the Second Month Lancet.Such a judgment was truly terrifying.But before the middle-aged man could say anything more, Han Xi looked at the bamboo and revealed a bitter smile.“Even if it’s a divine-tier cultivation art, what’s the point of me obtaining it now?”Han Xi’s heart felt like dead ashes.“At the very least, you can take revenge!”The middle-aged man subtly nodded.Han Xi’s character was worthy of his admiration.If she revealed even a trace of joy at the prospect of obtaining a high-grade cultivation art, he would instantly give up all thoughts on recruiting her.“Revenge?”Although Han Xi was angry at those sanctimonious great teachers, she had never thought about something like revenge.“Yes!”The middle-aged man drank a mouthful of soy milk.“Don’t you find their countenances very repulsive? Do they think that just by saying a few words of consolation after someone dies, they can simply mask the past?“The ultimate root of your student’s death was still because of all those fellows who chose to lock down knowledge and put bans on some line of thoughts.They have ‘chained’ all the young great teachers!“If Hua Jianmu could learn a top-grade cultivation art, even if he couldn’t defeat that Xuanyuan Po today, he would still be able to retreat safely.”Upon hearing the words of the middle-aged man, an intense resentment and unwillingness appeared in Han Xi’s heart.She recalled her path in the past when she was seeking knowledge.She remembered how great of a price she had to pay just to obtain this inferior-grade heaven-tier cultivation art.“As long as they exist, many great teachers and students will suffer the same tragedy.So, why don’t we overthrow them and change the great teacher world?”The middle-aged man suggested.“Overthrow them?”Han Xi’s heart suddenly pounded.After that, she looked at Hua Jianmu.Honestly speaking, when her personal student died, Han Xi sank into a daze.But now, this sentence from the middle-aged man awoke her.“If you no longer want to live, why don’t you use your body to do some contribution for those Han Xis and Hua Jianmus out there?”The middle-aged man stretched out his right hand and smiled at Han Xi.“Welcome to Dark Dawn!”This time around, Han Xi grabbed the middle-aged man’s hand with no hesitation although she had long since guessed his origins.But so what of it?“From now onward, you are a dark great teacher!”The middle-aged man finished his soymilk.“Let me introduce myself to you.I’m Li Poxiao, one of the seven Starlords within Dark Dawn.”Han Xi’s eyes widened.She didn’t expect that he would be a major character of this level.He seemed completely different from those rumors she heard about Dark Dawn.The personnel of Dark Dawn was supposed to be maniacs who killed people like plucking weeds, and darkness would envelop everywhere they passed!“There are many talented juniors in our Dark Dawn.I believe you will be able to find a new personal student!”Daybreak Starlord consoled.“No need!”Han Xi no longer wished to accept students.“Is that so? That’s truly regretful.I’m still anticipating a student of yours that can defeat Sun Mo’s personal students.But nevermind, it’s also pretty good if you can defeat Sun Mo!”The tone of the Daybreak Starlord was amiable and approachable.“I will!”Han Xi clutched the bamboo tube.(Jianmu, just you watch! I will defeat Sun Mo within three years to prove to you that I’m the strongest!)“In that case, you have to work hard in cultivation.After all, currently, there are many rising stars in our Dark Dawn who are leading their teams, planning to stir up trouble for Sun Mo.”The Daybreak Starlord encouraged.…The third round of the competition was covered in a gloomy aura due to Hua Jianmu’s death.However, the Saint Gate was such a large organization, and they had long since anticipated that something like this might happen.It was impossible for them to shut down the competition for the sake of a nameless student.Hence, the fourth round of the competition continued.Jiang Leng of the ‘A’ group was the first to fight.But when he saw his opponent, he was completely stunned.[1] Li Poxiao (name of Daybreak Starlord).Li stands for ‘Dawn’, Poxiao stands for ‘Daybreak’.\n"

      "Chapter 753: TreatmentTranslator: CKtalon Meng Chuan looked up and sensed the Heavenly Tribulation.It was targeting him—there was no escaping it.I’ll have to prepare for the Tribulation Transcendence next. Meng Chuan knew that he had to seize every moment.Whoosh.In the library, Meng Chuan placed the books on the bookshelf in front of him.He then stood up and walked out of the library.A group of Eminences had already gathered outside the library.They were all from White Avian Hall—Hall Lord White Avian, Lord of Shadowfiend, Deputy Hall Lord Azure Dragon, Deputy Hall Lord Blazing Sun, Palace Lord Food God, Lord of Shadows, Lord of the East Abyss, Cang Li, and Mountain Lord Moxie.When Meng Chuan walked out, all of them looked at Meng Chuan with complicated expressions.They were filled with disbelief, amazement, and puzzlement…“Meng Chuan, you broke through?” asked Hall Lord White Avian.The other Eminences listened carefully.Meng Chuan smiled and nodded.“I have, but I still need to transcend the eighth Essence Soul Tribulation.”The moment that was said, the Eminences present fell silent. He has really broken through! He has reached the legendary Eighth Tribulation realm!Although Meng Chuan still needed to transcend the tribulation before he could become an extended existence, Meng Chuan had already become an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence from this moment onward.He now had unimaginable strength at that level.Eighth Tribulation realm—this was a realm every Seventh Tribulation Eminence yearned for! Upon reaching this realm, one would gain many unimaginable means.They could make their homeworld a high-level world, and they could allow a portion of their clansmen to transcend Samsara and share lifespans with their homeworld.They could also explore endless spacetime and see scenery thousands of times more exciting.Typically, the probability of a Seventh Tribulation Eminence reaching the Eighth Tribulation realm was extremely low.But in this era—where three half-step Eighth Tribulation Eminences had once stood shoulder to shoulder—Meng Chuan had taken the critical step and truly reached the Eighth Tribulation realm.Only the final tribulation trial remained.“Congratulations, Eastcalm.” Lord of Shadowfiend congratulated him.“Congratulations, City Lord Eastcalm.” All the Eminences present congratulated him.At that moment, their attitudes were much more humbler.Seventh Tribulation Eminences could only affect an era after all.The River of Spacetime’s fundamental situation was decided by Eighth Tribulation Eminences.If an Eighth Tribulation Eminence wanted to build a faction, they could exist for billions of years.If they offended an Eighth Tribulation Eminence, even someone as powerful as Celestial Thearch Myriad Star would end up in a tragic state.“Do you need to keep your breakthrough a secret?” asked Hall Lord White Avian.“There’s no need to keep it a secret.” Meng Chuan shook his head.He believed that many Eighth Tribulation Eminences in the River of Spacetime had sensed his elevation in life’s natural order.He could vaguely sense that there were Eighth Tribulation Eminences sleeping and hiding in this universe.However, they were isolated by array formations.Meng Chuan could determine that they were still alive, but he didn’t know their exact locations.He had just broken through, but without an array formation isolating him, the Eighth Tribulation Eminences would’ve known about his breakthrough.There was no need to hide it.“Understood.” Hall Lord White Avian nodded before he couldn’t help saying, “Meng Chuan, I have something to discuss with you.”“Hall Lord, let’s talk in detail when we reach your residence.” Meng Chuan smiled.He naturally guessed what Hall Lord wanted to say.Soon, the two went to a courtyard in the hall.The other Eminences didn’t dare to disturb them.“Look at my injuries.Can they be treated?” asked Hall Lord White Avian immediately as he sat down.Meng Chuan looked at Hall Lord White Avian, but he could already see the other party’s Essence Soul clearly.He saw the alien powers that permeated everywhere.It was a Power of Essence Soul at the same level as him.“In terms of bodies, a Physical Body Eighth Tribulation Eminence has the advantage,” said Meng Chuan.“But in terms of unpredictable strength, an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence’s Power of Essence Soul is stronger.The one who attacked you was an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence.The Power of Essence Soul seeped into one of your avatars, passed through karma and your thoughts, and naturally transmitted to your homeworld’s true body.”“Thought transmission?” Hall Lord White Avian was alarmed.“By knowing him, remembering him, and understanding him, his strength is naturally able to seep into you,” explained Meng Chuan.“If he’s willing, he can even use your outer realm true body’s mark to condense an Essence Soul true body and descend into our universe.Of course, he didn’t kill you because your homeworld’s true body has always been in your homeworld, and he’s unable to enter your homeworld.”“Yes, our universe is Dragon Ancestor’s home universe.I heard that he’s quite famous beyond the universe, so he won’t easily storm his way here,” said Hall Lord White Avian self-deprecatingly.“In his eyes, I’m probably a tiny ant that’s not worth mentioning.Just a nap, and I’ll die of old age.It’s not worth paying a huge price for me.”As Meng Chuan listened, his Power of Essence Soul seeped into Hall Lord White Avian.Hall Lord White Avian suddenly felt like Meng Chuan’s eyes were like an endless universe.He couldn’t help but be dazed.Meng Chuan’s Power of Essence Soul affected Hall Lord White Avian’s mind.Through karma and mental transmission, it also seeped into his other true body in his homeworld.His two true bodies were affected at the same time.Hall Lord White Avian’s mind was slightly distorted and changed.The evil power began to be expelled.Meng Chuan could sense that the other party was about the same level as him.As a sourceless water, the other party’s infiltration powers naturally couldn’t withstand his; this was like fighting for territory.A Physical Body Seventh Tribulation Eminence like Hall Lord White Avian was unable to stop Meng Chuan and a peer equal to him from corroding him with their Power of Essence Soul.Moments later, Meng Chuan’s Power of Essence Soul completely expelled the other party’s before retracting his strength.Huh? Hall Lord White Avian fell into a daze.“My injuries?” Hall Lord White Avian was pleasantly surprised to discover that he had completely recovered.“Why can’t I remember what the Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence that injured me looks like?” Hall Lord White Avian immediately discovered the changes in his body.At his realm, he would immediately discover the changes in his body.“Only by doing so will it be a complete cure,” explained Meng Chuan.“If you still remember him clearly, he will be able to infiltrate and corrode you again.”Hall Lord White Avian was secretly alarmed.The Eighth Tribulation Eminences he came into contact with were all Physical Body Eighth Tribulation Eminences.The only Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence he had met was an enemy.At that moment, he felt that an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence’s means were much more sinister than those of a Physical Body Eighth Tribulation Eminence.It was impossible to guard against them.“I know that Black Fiend Hall’s Power of Nightmare is strange, but I feel that an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence’s power is much more terrifying.I can’t even know his name or have intelligence on him.” Hall Lord White Avian sighed.“When I was at the half-step Eighth Tribulation realm, I once treated Poison Eye and witnessed the Power of Nightmare.That was a formulation comprehended by Black Fiend Progenitor,” said Meng Chuan.“An Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence’s power is unique to those who have cultivated the Essence Soul lineage to the Eighth Tribulation realm.It’s not easy for Physical Body Eighth Tribulation Eminences to possess such means.”Now that Hall Lord White Avian had recovered from his injuries, he was in a much better mood.“Back then, I thought that if an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence were to appear in this era, only you would stand a chance.However, I was just clinging onto any hope of survival in my despair.I knew how difficult it was to give birth to an Essence Soul Eighth Tribulation Eminence.Who knew that you would really succeed?”Meng Chuan shook his head and said, “I haven’t transcended the tribulation yet.”“You will definitely succeed.” Hall Lord White Avian was more confident than Meng Chuan after seeing his journey.“If I fail to transcend the tribulation, please take care of my homeworld,” said Meng Chuan.Hall Lord White Avian was slightly taken aback before he said solemnly, “I promise with my life that I will watch over your homeworld with all my might.However, I still believe that it’s not my place to watch over a high-level world when you transcend the tribulation successfully.”“I’ll be counting on your blessings.” Meng Chuan wasn’t confident because he knew too little about the eighth Essence Soul Tribulation.Huh? Meng Chuan suddenly sensed something and looked up.A tall man with long, narrow eyes had already arrived outside the door.He looked at Meng Chuan with kindness in his eyes.Meng Chuan looked at him.“Greetings, Eastcalm; I’m Crimson Peace.” The tall man walked into the courtyard.Hall Lord White Avian didn’t notice him at all.He was in a completely different spacetime.The person was none other than Perfected Lord Crimson Peace, an Eighth Tribulation Eminence.“Greetings, Perfected Lord Crimson Peace.” As Meng Chuan spoke to Hall Lord White Avian, he sent his Essence Soul avatar into this layer of spacetime and stood up to welcome Perfected Lord Crimson Peace.\n"

      "Chapter 2958: Seeing He Qianqian AgainThe Heavenly Crane clan sat on top of a huge, icy mountain.Everything within ten million kilometers of the icy mountain was the Heavenly Crane clan’s territory.Beneath the icy mountain was a colossal city completely carved out of ice.The city was called the Divine City of the Heavenly Crane!The Heavenly Crane clan was like a hermit clan on the Ice Pole Plane.Weaker cultivators even had no idea about the Heavenly Crane clan’s existence.The Divine City of Heavenly Crane was a city specially built by the Heavenly Crane clan as a form of contact with the outside world, as well as to gather some items that the Heavenly Crane clan regularly required.Today, outside the Divine City of Heavenly Crane, the space above an expansive tundra twisted slightly, and an old man in white appeared there silently.The old man was Jian Chen in disguise.“The Divine City of Heavenly Crane should be here!” Jian Chen hovered above the icy-cold tundra and gazed at the snow-white city several dozen kilometers away before taking a step.When he took the step, his figure immediately vanished.By the time he reappeared, he was already standing in the Divine City of Heavenly Crane.The city lord’s estate was right in front of Jian Chen!Several guards dressed in snow-white armour with the cultivation of Gods stood as straight as spears, guarding the entrance of the estate loyally.The guards obviously noticed Jian Chen’s sudden appearance, but they had watched the entrance for a very long time now, so they had witnessed all sorts of experts before.As a result, they had grown accustomed to something like this already.Immediately, a guard arrived before Jian Chen and asked, “Senior, how may I be of service?”“Take me to your city lord!”In the city lord’s estate, the city lord received Jian Chen enthusiastically.As the highest point of contact the Heavenly Crane clan had stationed in the outside world, the city lord obviously was not a Godhood cultivation.Instead, he was a First Heavenly Layer Infinite Prime.“I’ve come hoping that the city lord can assist me with something.I hope the city lord can pass this tablet onto He Qianqian of the Heavenly Crane clan for me,” Jian Chen said to the city lord as he took out a tablet.Meanwhile, he intentionally gave off the presence of a Chaotic Prime.The customs of the Heavenly Crane clan were a little different.If any outsiders visited, they had to go to the Divine City of Heavenly Crane, which would pass on the message to the clan.They would only let them in once the upper echelon of the clan granted permission.Otherwise, if Jian Chen tried using the method when he visited the Pill King clan of planet Tianming on the Heavenly Crane clan, it would be viewed as a form of provocation no matter how sincere he was.It was not just the Heavenly Crane clan.This was a custom adopted by many peak organisations on the Ice Pole Plane.Perhaps because the strength Jian Chen had displayed was far too great, the city lord dared not brush him aside, let alone decline Jian Chen’s request.After all, it was just passing on an item.Even a clan as powerful as the Heavenly Crane clan would not want to offend someone on par with great elders over such a trifle.Moreover, he could tell with a single glance that the tablet belonged to the Heavenly Crane clan.The city lord immediately returned to the Heavenly Crane clan with the tablet as quickly as possible.In the end, the tablet reached He Qianqian’s hands after being passed through numerous people.At this moment, on some training grounds in the Heavenly Crane clan, He Qianqian wore a set of white, tight-fitting robes that completely outlined her slender and graceful figure.Currently, she held a sword, having just unleashed a God Tier Battle Skill, which made energy surge through the training grounds.The heavenly might of a God Tier Battle Skill slowly receded.“Young miss, this is something sent over from the divine city outside.The elder stationed at the divine city gave special orders to pass this to you.The item has already been checked.There are no issues with it.”At this moment, He Qianqian’s trusted maidservant presented a wooden box before He Qianqian and passed it to her.Having just used a God Tier Battle Skill, He Qianqian seemed rather out of breath.She wiped away her sweat and opened the wooden box in a very unconcerned manner.A tablet that could clearly represent the Heavenly Crane clan to a certain degree sat quietly in the wooden box.When He Qianqian saw the tablet, her unconcerned mindset suddenly froze.Her eyes narrowed, becoming fixed on the tablet.The tablets of the Heavenly Crane clan all seemed the same, but in reality, there were some minute differences between tablets.They could identify the owners of the various tablets through these tiny differences.As a result, He Qianqian realised that the tablet belonged to her as soon as she saw it.Of course, the most important aspect was He Qianqian had only given away one of these tablets over the past few centuries!He Qianqian grabbed the tablet instinctively.Her mind was in a daze, and her emotions were mixed.A while later, He Qianqian turned around and left the training grounds without saying anything at all.Two hours later, she had already left the Heavenly Crane clan and appeared in the Divine City of Heavenly Crane, making her way towards the city lord’s estate.“I am in a snowy fir forest outside the city.” But suddenly, a voice drifted through He Qianqian’s head.Hearing the voice, He Qianqian’s chilling eyes immediately rippled.She immediately changed directions and flew towards the snowy fir forest outside the Divine City of Heavenly Crane.Very soon, He Qianqian saw the familiar figure in the forest.Jian Chen had returned to the appearance he had used back in the Hundred Saint City.Of course, this was not his real appearance, as this was the only appearance He Qianqian could find familiarity in.He Qianqian’s clothes were even whiter than the snow.As she stood in the world of ice, she seemed to become one with it.She maintained a thirty-meter-distance between her and Jian Chen, and her gaze towards Jian Chen was extremely mixed.“It’s been over two centuries since we last met.Miss Qian’s grace is the same as always, or even better than in the past now.” Jian Chen smiled.He Qianqian said nothing.Her gaze was fixed on Jian Chen, sometimes mixed, sometimes sharp, and sometimes cold.It was quite obvious that she was filled with mixed feelings right now.She could not help but recall the two figures Jian Chen had disguised himself as in the Darkstar World.One was the talented Godking on good terms with the Hundred Saint City who wielded both the Laws of the Sword and the Laws of Space.The other was the fifth hall master who possessed paramount authority in the Darkstar World, who even contended against the seventh hall master to protect the Hundred Saint City and had fooled the many organisations of the Hundred Saint City out of large quantities of divine crystals!“Who are you exactly?” Only quite a while later did He Qianqian speak.She realised she had never truly gotten to know the Yang Yutian before her.“You can just treat me as the Yang Yutian of the past, miss Qian.” Jian Chen smiled wryly.“Yang Yutian shouldn’t be your true appearance.Your current appearance must be a disguise created through some special method too.” He Qianqian said.Her voice was rather cold.Jian Chen nodded.“Yang Yutian, I treated you like a friend back then in the Darkstar World, but what did you do? Even right now, I still don’t know what your true identity is.I don’t even know who you are.Is that how you repay me?” He Qianqian became slightly angered.\n"

      "The conference room was dark. The lights were all off, and only the screen was shining white. Over 10 men and women were sitting in this conference room.“Then tell me what you think.How can Alley Leader protect his territory?” Kale said while pointing at the white screen.On it, the words ‘Etono Defense’ were written in black.A man raised his hand and presented his opinion: “The first thing we need to know is the degree of force that Alley Leader possesses.There is no need to worry if Alley Leader can beat an earl-grade demon.”In the video Hyeonu sent them, it was said that earl-grade demons were very rare.This meant that the possibility of having the territory taken away was much lower if Hyeonu had a force above that of an earl.“However, the demon king of iron blood has been deprived of his territory, and his power is now reduced.He will try to recover Etono by all means.We can’t be too complacent,” a blonde beauty refuted the man’s words.There were 72 cities and a total of 7 demon kings in the demon world. On average, 10 cities belonged to one demon king. In other words, the demon king’s force had decreased by one-tenth after losing Etono. There was no guarantee that only earl-grade demons would come for Hyeonu.“That makes sense.It can be said that his force has reduced rapidly.The demon king of iron blood might send demons of a level higher than the earl grade to Etono,” Kale agreed with the woman’s comments.The possibility was present, and it wasn’t a low one.Another employee raised his hand and suggested, “Then how about giving it to another demon king? It will be under the command of a demon on the same side as the demon king of iron blood.” Kale tilted his head and wondered, “The same side? Not the opposite side?”He remarked inwardly, ‘Isn’t it a common idea to join with the opposing side?’The staff member who put forward the opinion expanded on his idea: “As you said, a city is rare.This means it is highly valued.However, it is definitely less valuable compared with an alliance between demon kings.”Kale noticed what the employee was trying to say. It wasn’t known what factions there were among the seven demon kings. Nevertheless, there would surely be relationships with conflicts. The use of force was normal in the demon world, so it might be even worse. In such a situation, what if your territory was absorbed by an allied demon king? It was possible to protest it, but breaking the alliance would ultimately be impossible.Looking at it as a whole, the alliance had 20 cities. Yet when dividing it, it was a ratio of 11 and 9. One side had the advantage. Since the other side had already lost in the struggle for power, they had no choice but to put up with it.“However, that is too much of a gamble.We still don’t know enough about the relationship between the demon kings.I’ll reserve this opinion for later,” Kale stated. He kept the man’s opinion in mind because it wasn’t ridiculous at all. It was just a pretty uneasy strategy to choose now due to a lack of information about demon kings.“I will take opinions from others.There is still a lot of time left in this meeting,” Kale said with a smile. The other employees in the conference room started to actively express their opinions. They knew exactly what Kale’s smile meant—the meeting wouldn’t end until a satisfactory result was reached.***The next morning, Hyeonu looked at a banana that only had the peel remaining and pressed his lips together. He felt very hungry because he had been receiving personal training since earlier in the morning.Nevertheless, he wasn’t going to eat anything else as he had already eaten a chicken breast salad and a banana.After placing the banana peel in the trash can, Hyeonu opened the door of the Cube and entered it. He was going to connect to Arena. Just then, Hyeonu’s smartphone started shaking, but his phone had been thrown onto his thick blanket. No matter how hard it rang, the ringtone didn’t enter Hyeonu’s ears.The thick blanket covered all the noise. The vibration of the smartphone quickly stopped. After a while, the phone’s LCD screen lit up.A message from someone appeared on the screen.-It is Kale. I have emailed the options to you. If there is anything you like, you can use it. If you don’t like them, please contact us again.It was a message from Kale. He had chosen some ideas that felt pretty good after a few hours of discussion. Then he sent it to Hyeonu’s email. Normally, Kale would wait for Hyeonu to confirm it and give him an answer, but the situation was currently very urgent.He wanted Hyeonu to check the email quickly, so he got in touch like this.However, Hyeonu had already accessed Arena and couldn’t see his message.***Hyeonu appeared in Etono and ran straight to the Colosseum. The most important thing for him right now was the restoration of the Colosseum. At the very least, the location of the room where Viscount Ergal had been located had to be cleared.This was the place where the magic power stone was probably located.‘This way, I can use Magic Power Absorption.’Hyeonu’s ultimate purpose for doing all of this was to absorb magic power. He had an opportunity to be strong easily.Not many people would ignore such an opportunity, even more so if it wasn’t illegal. Nonetheless, other players couldn’t gain a lot of magic power like Hyeonu even if they used Magic Power Absorption.Magic Power Absorption had the highest level of difficulty. The provided compensation was really great, so it was designed to be very difficult to get. Hyeonu’s successful result was abnormal.Once Hyeonu arrived at the repair site of the Colosseum, his eyes widened at the sight in front of him.“What? This is...?” Hyeonu immediately had a dumbfounded expression. The construction was proceeding strangely. The Colosseum that should’ve been restored to its original state was half-destroyed. It was too absurd. They were destroying good buildings rather than repairing buildings...Hyeonu approached a demon that was shouting at other demons. The demon wore a yellow hat and looked like he was in charge of the construction site. Hyeonu stuck his face in front of the person in charge and roared, “What is going on?”“Viscount, you came?!” The demon in the yellow hat was startled by Hyeonu’s sudden appearance and bowed.Still, he didn’t stutter or look afraid.“I’ll ask again.Why are you breaking the Colosseum?”Despite being faced with Hyeonu’s growl, the demon calmly reported the construction situation: “There was a problem that wasn’t visible in the Colosseum.There are cracks all over the place due to a strong impact...If we leave it like this, it is expected to collapse in a few days, and the damaged parts would have to be repaired again.” ‘There was a problem that couldn’t be seen?’ Hyeonu’s expression changed rapidly. His mind regained its calmness in an instant. There was no reason to be agitated now that he knew the destruction was part of the recovery work. He just had something to say. “Instead, the internal structure should be the same as before.That room as well.Do you understand?”This was something that couldn’t be changed. Anything else could be changed, but Viscount Ergal’s room must not be changed.That shouldn’t happen. Hyeonu patted the demon’s shoulder several times while making the request.“Yes, I understand.Viscount Argon.” The demon nodded several times at Hyeonu’s words.Just then, a dusty breeze rose on the other side of the Colosseum. Hyeonu saw it and frowned.‘What? I suddenly feel very uneasy...’He was anxious and felt an ominous pressure like when his mother picked up his report card that had bad grades.“Finish the construction no matter what,” Hyeonu said and decided to leave his position without overcoming his uneasiness. He patted the demon’s shoulder even as he immediately began to make his exit. Kicking off from the ground, Hyeonu jumped into the air and disappeared as he crossed through the sky like a flying bird.Shortly after Hyeonu left the construction site, a muscular giant that was nearly three meters tall appeared. The giant released pressure in rough waves while examining the construction site with a mysterious light flashing in his eyes. Then he turned his head like he didn’t see what he was looking for. Just like how Hyeonu had done a moment ago, the giant approached the demon in the yellow hat and asked about Hyeonu’s whereabouts: “Where is Viscount Argon?”The giant’s pressure didn’t weaken at all. Rather, he was releasing even more pressure in accordance with his mood.Nevertheless, the demon in the yellow hat wasn’t intimidated at all and answered the giant’s question: “He just left because he had business to do.”“Which way did he go?”“He went north,” the man in the yellow hat lied naturally without changing his expression.Hyeonu had headed west, not north. Nevertheless, the giant didn’t know this and ran north.***‘Well done.’ In fact, Hyeonu hadn’t run away. He was watching the construction site from a moderately distant place.Although he’d fled due to a sense of anxiety, he stopped and hid in the end.‘That isn’t a viscount.He is at least an earl...’Even from a distance, the giant’s pressure was bloodthirsty enough to make Hyeonu’s hairs stand up.The giant absolutely wasn’t a viscount.‘First...should I run away?’Although the giant in front of him was a problem, the bigger problem was that the giant wouldn’t be the end of this. Killing the giant wouldn’t solve the problem.There would always be risk factors unless the underlying problem was solved.‘In any case, they won’t be able to get the territory without the ring.’If Hyeonu abandoned Etono and escaped, it didn’t mean he would be stripped of his territory. The lordship was just a name. The really important thing was the ring. If he failed to absorb the magic power, then it was no different from increasing his workload, even though he had obtained a territory. It wouldn’t increase his power.All that would increase was the size of the area in which he needed to defeat more enemies.‘I have to leave Etono until the construction of the Colosseum is over.’Hyeonu was thinking about returning once the Colosseum was completed to use Magic Power Absorption. After that, the loss of the territory wouldn’t be a huge damage.The loss of gold was a pity, but it was a cheap price if he could raise his magic power stat by more than 100.‘Be good until then, Etono.’Hyeonu stared at the Colosseum that contained the magic power stone for a moment before moving.\n"

      "Chapter 204: Chapter 204 Feng Zhiwei immediately tried to explain: “The truth is that His Highness is gay.”Hua Qiong laughed, her voice tinkling: “You are very interesting… How could a person like His Highness be gay?”“What kind of person?” Feng Zhiwei asked with great interest, curious how other’s say Ning Yi.“His Highness is not an affectionate man; on the contrary, he is very heartless.” Hua Qiong explained.“You did not see what happened in South Sea with your own eyes, but His Highness’s ruthless and cold acts shocked many people.He is a great man suited for great things, and his determination and perseverance lets nothing distract him from his goals.His actions are as fierce as lightning; a man like him who sets his sights on the world thinks and plans about everything, and he would never allow any errors or mistakes… not even if they came from his own heart.”Feng Zhiwei smiled: “Yes, he holds himself well.”“He is only different around you.” Hua Qiong concluded boldly.Feng Zhiwei was silent, a gentle warmth in her eyes.Hua Qiong sat beside her cheerfully smiling, the autumn sunlight spilling out on the large, white stone yard behind her, vast like an ocean.“Why do you want to leave?” Feng Zhiwei changed the subject after a moment.“For my own happiness.” Hua Qiong replied.“I am not in Huaishi’s heart, not even if I marry him.He only agreed before because it was useful, and to have him silently accept someone else’s child as Yan Changtian? I would not be willing even if he were.”“You deserve this.” Feng Zhiwei calmly replied.“If you had not cast aside your name and risked your life, Huaishi would not be here today.If he chooses some other woman, I would be the first one to stop him.”“He is willing to marry me, but I am not willing to marry him.” Hua Qiong smiled, proud.“How could I, Hua Qiong, marry a man who forces himself to be with me? If I marry him, even if he respects me for his entire life, he will never love me.”Feng Zhiwei gazed into the woman’s complicated eyes and finally understood her pride and composure.This marriage would always leave a knot in Madam Chen and Yan Huaishi’s hearts.They would always feel wronged — an ordinary village girl pregnant with another man’s child could never be a proper match for the Yan Family Head, and even if Yan Huaishi cared for her, he did not love her.Another girl might still marry Yan Huaishi because she had earned it, but Hua Qiong would not.“When you leave South Sea, I want to follow you.” Hua Qiong said sincerely, holding Feng Zhiwei’s hand.“You have risen in this world and claimed a place in the Imperial Court, stepping into the purple clouds.I greatly admire you, and I wish to stay by your side so that you can bring me with you to see more of the heavens and earth.”“You must understand, once you leave, Huaishi will owe you nothing.He will likely marry another woman.”“If he can forget me so easily, why should I risk my life and happiness for him?” Hua Qiong smiled calmly.“Though I like him, I also have my own bottom line.”The young girl sat perfectly straight like a tall, strong pine saluting the sun.Her eyes shone bright and brilliant, and her face was calm and clear.“I don’t want him to marry me out of pity or gratitude just to end up in an imperfect marriage, and I do not want take on the mantle and responsibilities of Madam Yan because my husband and mother-in-law think they own me.I want to hold my own fate, and I want to grow in Tian Sheng Dynasty’s mountains and seas.I want Yan Huaishi to one day have no choice but to life his eyes and see me, and I want him to one day know that my love for him is taller than mountains and wider than oceans, surpassing everything.”After this conversation with Hua Qiong, Feng Zhiwei spent a long time thinking.Hua Qiong sitting under the autumn sun filled her mind’s eye as her words echoed in her ears, and Feng Zhiwei felt that only an unfettered, gallant woman could dare swear that her love surpassed mountains and oceans and everything else, and Feng Zhiwei believed her.A sudden envy and quiet sadness filled her heart and she realized that Yan Huaishi was truly uncommonly blessed.Through that quiet night, Feng Zhiwei lay sleepless and full of thoughts.Where was Ning Yi’s army now? The South Sea Province neighbored Minnan, so he must be marching through the night.She thought of his eyes — he had stayed so long, delaying his trip and holding off on his treatment for her.How could he lead his army with such a malady? Would he be able to find the right medicine? What if the long delay meant that he would never see again? Of course he did not need to personally fight, but arrows and sword have no eyes.What if? What would she do?Cold sweat covered her and thoughts of Gu Nanyi flashed into mind.That mysterious physician could rush over and catch up to Ning Yi and protect him.She lifted her eyes and began knocking on the wall.Young Master Gu immediately floated down and touched her forehead.Feng Zhiwei stirred, staring in shock — amazing! Young Master Gu was voluntarily touching someone!Young Master Gu ignored her astonished gazed; he had broken so many of his rules recently that touching her forehead seemed like nothing.After rubbing his hand over her entire face, he felt that she was somewhat warm, but he had to touch his own face to compare.In order to touch his face, he had to lift his veil a little.Feng Zhiwei held her breath as Gu Nanyi revealed some of his face, hating herself for not lighting an oil lamp.After a moment, she comforted herself; the more she saw, the more serious to consequences that would follow.In order to avoid those consequences, she hurriedly turned away.Meanwhile, Young Master Gu had come to his conclusion — Feng Zhiwei’s body was burning from all the thoughts that filled her mind so Young Master Gu thought that her fever had come back, so he quickly dragged over a quilt, skillfully arranged it by the foot of the bed, and then curled up on the ground.Feng Zhiwei watched in astonishment.What?She had not known that Young Master Gu had watched over her, and Young Master Gu had never brought it up.Feng Zhiwei could only stare blankly as Young Master Gu fell asleep hugging his blanket, his tall body curled up around the short feet of the bed.The hard floor was clearly uncomfortable and Feng Zhiwei had a hard time reconciling the imperious young man who cared so much for his own comfort and the quiet figure laying by her bed.As she looked down at the calm and casual way he slept, it was very clear that this habit had not formed in just a day.Feng Zhiwei leaned over, her hand clutching her bedside.She stared down at Gu Nanyi and could not help but think back to how Ning Yi had rushed over and banged himself against her bed, and her heart trembled and her grip tightened on the bed’s wood, and a small piece of wood chip drifted down onto Gu Nanyi’s veil.Gu Nanyi opened his eyes and looked up into Feng Zhiwei’s staring eyes and he remembered what he had wanted to say that very first night he began laying by her bed, waiting for her to wake.\n"
